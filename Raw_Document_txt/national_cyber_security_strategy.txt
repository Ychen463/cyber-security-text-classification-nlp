FOREWORD 

FOREWORD
 

The UK is one of the world’s leading 
digital nations. Much of our prosperity 
now depends on our ability to secure our 
technology, data and networks from the 
many threats we face. 

Yet cyber attacks are growing more 
frequent, sophisticated and damaging when 
they succeed. So we are taking decisive 
action to protect both our economy and the 
privacy of UK citizens. 

 
Our National Cyber Security Strategy sets out 
 
our plan to make Britain confident, capable 
and resilient in a fast-moving digital world. 

Over the lifetime of this five-year strategy, 
we will invest £1.9 billion in defending 
our systems and infrastructure, deterring 
our adversaries, and developing a whole-
society capability – from the biggest 
companies to the individual citizen. 

From the most basic cyber hygiene, to the 
most sophisticated deterrence, we need a 
comprehensive response. 

We will focus on raising the cost of 
mounting an attack against anyone in the 
UK, both through stronger defences and 
better cyber skills. This is no longer just 
an issue for the IT department but for the 
whole workforce. Cyber skills need to reach 
into every profession. 

The new National Cyber Security Centre will 
provide a hub of world-class, user-friendly 
expertise for businesses and individuals, as 
well as rapid response to major incidents. 

Government has a clear leadership role, 
but we will also foster a wider commercial 
ecosystem, recognising where industry 
can innovate faster than us. This includes 
a drive to get the best young minds into 
cyber security. 

The cyber threat impacts the whole of our 
society, so we want to make very clear 
that everyone has a part to play in our 
national response. It’s why this strategy is 
an unprecedented exercise in transparency. 
We can no longer afford to have this 
discussion behind closed doors. 

 
Ultimately, this is a threat that cannot be 
 
completely eliminated. Digital technology 
 
works because it is open, and that 
 
openness brings with it risk. What we 
 
can do is reduce the threat to a level that 
 
ensures we remain at the vanguard of the 
digital revolution. This strategy sets out how. 

The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, 
Chancellor of the Exchequer 

National Cyber Security Strategy 20167 

PREFACE 

As Minister for the Cabinet Office with 
responsibility for cyber security and 
government security, I am determined 
 
to see this strategy implemented in full. 
 
I will work closely with colleagues across 
Government and with partners in the 
Devolved Administrations, the wider public 
sector, industry and academia to ensure we 
achieve that ambition. 

The Rt Hon Ben Gummer MP, 
Minister for the Cabinet Office 
 
and Paymaster General 

PREFACE
 

Our primary responsibility is to keep 
 
the nation safe and deliver competent 
 
government. This strategy reflects these 
 
duties. It is a bold and ambitious approach to 
 
tackling the many threats our country faces in 
 
cyberspace. Managing and mitigating those 
 
threats is a task for us all but the Government 
 
recognises its special responsibility to lead 
 
the national effort required. 
 
The Government is committed to ensuring 
the commitments set out in this strategy 
are carried out and that we accurately 
monitor and regularly report on progress 
in meeting them. We will also keep our 
approach under review and respond to 
changes in the level of threat we face as 
well as evolutions in security technologies. 
 
Government also has a special 
 
responsibility to the citizen, to companies 
 
and organisations operating in the UK, 
 
and to our international allies and partners. 
 
We should be able to assure them that 
 
every effort made has been to render our 
 
systems safe and to protect our data and 
 
our networks from attack or interference. 
 
We must therefore set ourselves the highest 
 
standards of cyber security and ensure we 
 
adhere to them, both as the cornerstone 
 
of the country’s national security and 
 
economic wellbeing and also as an example 
 
for others to follow. We shall report back on 
 
progress made on an annual basis.

1. EXECUTIVE 
 
SUMMARY 
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY9 

The future of the UK’s security and 

1.1. 
 
prosperity rests on digital foundations. 
The challenge of our generation is to build 
a flourishing digital society that is both 
resilient to cyber threats, and equipped with 
the knowledge and capabilities required to 
maximise opportunities and manage risks. 

 

1.2.  We are critically dependent on the 
Internet. However, it is inherently insecure 
and there will always be attempts to exploit 
weaknesses to launch cyber attacks. This 
threat cannot be eliminated completely, but 
the risk can be greatly reduced to a level 
that allows society to continue to prosper, 
and benefit from the huge opportunities 
that digital technology brings. 

The 2011 National Cyber Security 

1.3. 
 
Strategy, underpinned by the British 
Government’s £860m National Cyber 
Security Programme, has delivered 
substantial improvements to UK cyber 
security. It achieved important outcomes 
by looking to the market to drive secure 
cyber behaviours. But this approach has 
not achieved the scale and pace of change 
required to stay ahead of the fast moving 
threat. We now need to go further. 

  

1.4.  Our vision for 2021 is that 
 
the UK is secure and resilient to 
 
cyber threats, prosperous and 
 
confident in the digital world. 

To realise this vision we will 
 

1.5. 
 
work to achieve the following objectives: 

•	 DEFEND We have the 
 

means to defend the UK 
against evolving cyber 
threats, to respond 
effectively to incidents, to 
ensure UK networks, data and systems 
 
are protected and resilient. Citizens, 
businesses and the public sector 
 
have the knowledge and ability to 
defend themselves. 

•	 DETER The UK will be a 
 

hard target for all forms of 
aggression in cyberspace. 
We detect, understand, 
investigate and disrupt 
hostile action taken against us, 
pursuing and prosecuting offenders. 
We have the means to take offensive 
action in cyberspace, should we 
choose to do so. 

•	 DEVELOP We have 
 

an innovative, growing 
cyber security industry, 
underpinned by world-
leading scientific 
research and development. We have 
a self-sustaining pipeline of talent 
providing the skills to meet our national 
needs across the public and private 
sectors. Our cutting-edge analysis 
 
and expertise will enable the UK to 
meet and overcome future threats 
 
and challenges. 

 

1.6.  Underpinning these objectives, we 
 
will pursue INTERNATIONAL ACTION 
 
and exert our influence by investing in 
 
partnerships that shape the global evolution 
 
of cyberspace in a manner that advances 
 
our wider economic and security interests. 
 
We will deepen existing links with our 
 
closest international partners, recognising 
 
that this enhances our collective security. 
 
We will also develop relationships with new 
 
partners to build their levels of cyber security 
 
and protect UK interests overseas. We will 
 
do this both bilaterally and multilaterally, 
 
including through the EU, NATO and the 
 
UN. We will deliver clear messages about 
 
consequences to adversaries who threaten 
 
to harm our interests, or those of our allies, 
 
in cyberspace. 
 

1.7. 
 
To achieve these outcomes over 
 
the next five years, the UK Government 
 
intends to intervene more actively and use 
 
increased investment, while continuing 
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 1EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1.11.  We will have the means to respond 
to cyber attacks in the same way as 
we respond to any other attack, using 
whichever capability is most appropriate, 
including an offensive cyber capability. 

 

1.12.  We will use the authority and 
influence of the UK Government to invest 
in programmes to address the shortage of 
cyber security skills in the UK, from schools 
to universities and across the workforce. 

 

1.13.  We will launch two new cyber 
innovation centres to drive the development 
of cutting-edge cyber products and 
dynamic new cyber security companies. 
We will also allocate a proportion of the 
£165m Defence and Cyber Innovation 
Fund to support innovative procurement in 
defence and security. 

 

1.14.  We will invest a total of £1.9 billion 
over the next five years to transform 
significantly the UK’s cyber security. 

10 

to support market forces to raise cyber 
 
security standards across the UK. The 
 
UK Government, in partnership with the 
 
Devolved Administrations of Scotland, 
 
Wales and Northern Ireland, will work with 
 
the private and public sectors to ensure that 
 
individuals, businesses and organisations 
 
adopt the behaviours required to stay safe 
 
on the Internet. We will have measures in 
 
place to intervene (where necessary and 
 
within the scope of our powers) to drive 
 
improvements that are in the national 
 
interest, particularly in relation to the cyber 
 
security of our critical national infrastructure. 

1.8. 
 
The UK Government will draw on 
its capabilities and those of industry to 
develop and apply active cyber defence 
measures to significantly enhance the levels 
of cyber security across UK networks. 
These measures include minimising the 
most common forms of phishing attacks, 
filtering known bad IP addresses, and 
actively blocking malicious online activity. 
Improvements in basic cyber security 
will raise the UK’s resilience to the most 
commonly deployed cyber threats. 

 

1.9.  We have created a National Cyber 
Security Centre (NCSC) to be the authority 
on the UK’s cyber security environment, 
sharing knowledge, addressing systemic 
vulnerabilties and providing leadership on 
key national cyber security issues. 

 

1.10.  We will ensure that our Armed Forces 
 
are resilient and have the strong cyber 
 
defences they need to secure and defend 
 
their networks and platforms, continuing 
 
to operate and retaining global freedom of 
 
manoeuvre despite cyber threats. Our military 
 
Cyber Security Operations Centre will work 
 
closely with the NCSC and we will ensure 
 
that the Armed Forces can assist in the event 
 
of a significant national cyber attack.

against those threats. See Glossary for an explanation of all technical terms.

2. INTRODUCTION 

 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 2 INTRODUCTION13 

Information and communication 

2.1. 
 
technologies have evolved over the 
 
last two decades and are now integrated 
into virtually every aspect of our lives. 
 
The UK is a digitalised society. Our 
economy and our daily lives are the 
 
richer for it. 

2.2. 
 
The transformation brought 
about by this digitalisation creates 
new dependencies. Our economy, the 
administration of government and the 
provision of essential services now rely 
on the integrity of cyberspace and on the 
infrastructure, systems and data which 
underpin it. A loss of trust in that integrity 
would jeopardise the benefits of this 
technological revolution. 

determination to address cyber threats 
and “put in place tough and innovative 
measures, as a world leader in cyber 
security”. This National Cyber Security 
Strategy delivers on that commitment. 

In preparing this new strategy, 

2.6. 
 
the Government is building on the 
achievements, objectives and 
 
judgements of the first five-year 
 
National Cyber Security Strategy 
 
issued in 2011. The Government 
 
invested £860m over that period, and 
is proud of what has been achieved. 
The policies, institutions and initiatives 
developed over the last five years have 
helped to establish the UK as a leading 
global player in cyber security. 

 

2.3.  Much of the hardware and 
software originally developed to facilitate 
this interconnected digital environment 
has prioritised efficiency, cost and the 
convenience of the user, but has not always 
had security designed in from the start. 
Malicious actors – hostile states, criminal 
 
or terrorist organisations and individuals – 
can exploit the gap between convenience 
and security. Narrowing that gap is a 
national priority. 

These are sound foundations. 
 

2.7. 
 
But the persistence and ingenuity of those 
who would threaten us, the prevalence 
of our vulnerabilities and gaps in our 
capabilities and defences mean we need 
to work even harder to keep pace with 
the threat. A comprehensive approach is 
required if we are to effectively secure our 
cyber interests. Our resolution to make 
further investment and interventions is 
based on the following assessments: 

The expansion of the Internet 

2.4. 
 
beyond computers and mobile phones 
 
into other cyber-physical or ‘smart’ 
systems is extending the threat of remote 
exploitation to a whole host of new 
technologies. Systems and technologies 
that underpin our daily lives – such as 
power grids, air traffic control systems, 
satellites, medical technologies, industrial 
plants and traffic lights – are connected 
to the Internet and, therefore, potentially 
vulnerable to interference. 

The 2015 National Security 
 

2.5. 
 
Strategy (NSS) reaffirmed the cyber 
 
threat as a Tier One risk to UK interests. 
The NSS set out the Government’s 

•	 the scale and dynamic nature of cyber 
 

threats, and our vulnerability and 
dependency, mean that maintaining 
 
the current approach will not in itself 
 
be sufficient to keep us safe; 
•	 a market based approach to 
 
 

the promotion of cyber hygiene has 
 
not produced the required pace and 
scale of change; therefore, Government 
has to lead the way and intervene 
 
more directly by bringing its influence 
and resources to bear to address 
 
cyber threats; 

•	 the Government alone cannot provide 
 

for all aspects of the nation’s cyber 
security. An embedded and 
 
sustainable approach is needed 
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 2INTRODUCTION14 

where citizens, industry and other 
partners in society and government, 
play their full part in securing our 
networks, services and data; 

•	 the UK needs a vibrant cyber security 
 
sector and supporting skills base that 
can keep pace with and get ahead of 
the changing threat. 

THE SCOPE OF THE STRATEGY 

This strategy is intended to shape 
 

2.8. 
 
the Government’s policy, while also offering 
 
a coherent and compelling vision to share 
 
with the public and private sector, civil 
 
society, academia and the wider population. 

2.9. 
  
The strategy covers the whole of 
 
the UK. The UK Government will seek to 
 
ensure the strategy is implemented for 
 

all parts of the UK, recognising that, to 
 
the extent that it touches on devolved 
 
matters, we will work closely with the 
 
devolved Governments on its application 
 
to Scotland, Wales and Northern 
 
Ireland (respecting the three separate 
 
legal jurisdictions, and four education 
 
systems, that exist in the UK). Where 
 
proposals set out in the strategy relate to 
 
devolved matters, their implementation 
 
will be agreed as appropriate with those 
 
Governments in accordance with the 
 
devolution settlements. 

  

2.10.  The strategy sets out proposed 
 
or recommended actions aimed at all 
sectors of the economy and society, 
from central government departments, to 
leaders across industry and the individual 
citizen. The strategy aims to increase 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 2 INTRODUCTION15 

Section 2 
INTRODUCTION 

cyber security at all levels for our collective 
benefit and will be the basis on which the 
UK engages internationally to promote 
good internet governance. 

2.11. 
 
In this strategy, ‘cyber security’ 
refers to the protection of information 
systems (hardware, software and 
associated infrastructure), the data on 
them, and the services they provide, 
 
from unauthorised access, harm or misuse. 
This includes harm caused intentionally 
 
by the operator of the system, or 
accidentally, as a result of failing to 
 
follow security procedures. 

 

2.12.  Consistent with our assessment of 
the challenge we face and building on the 
achievements of the 2011 strategy, this 
document sets out: 

 
•	 our updated assessment of the 

strategic context, including the current 
and evolving threats: who poses the 
most serious threat to our interests, 
and the tools at their disposal; 

•	 a review of vulnerabilities and how these 
 
 
have developed over the last five years; 

•	 the Government’s vision for cyber 
 

security in 2021 and the key objectives 
to achieve that goal, including guiding 
principles, roles and responsibilities, 
and how and where government 
intervention will make a difference; 

•	 how we intend to put our policy 
 
 

into practice: setting out where the 
Government will lead and where we 
expect to work in partnership with 
others; and 

•	 how we intend to assess our progress 
 

towards our objectives.

3. STRATEGIC CONTEXT 

 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 3 STRATEGIC CONTEXT 

3.1.  When the last National Cyber 
Security Strategy was published in 2011, 
the scale of technological change and its 
impact was already apparent. The trends 
and opportunities described then have 
since accelerated. New technologies 
and applications have come to the fore, 
and greater uptake of internet-based 
technologies worldwide, in particular 
in developing countries, has offered 
increasing opportunities for economic and 
social development. These developments 
have brought, or will bring, significant 
advantages to connected societies such 
as ours. But as our reliance on networks 
in the UK and overseas grows, so do the 
opportunities for those who would seek 
to compromise our systems and data. 
Equally, the geopolitical landscape has 
changed. Malicious cyber activity knows 
no international boundaries. State actors 
are experimenting with offensive cyber 
capabilities. Cyber criminals are broadening 
their efforts and expanding their strategic 
modus operandi to achieve higher value 
pay-outs from UK citizens, organisations 
and institutions. Terrorists, and their 
sympathisers, are conducting low-level 
attacks and aspire to carry out more 
significant acts. This chapter sets out our 
assessment of the nature of these threats, 
our vulnerabilities and how these continue 
to evolve. 

17 

THREATS 

Cyber criminals 

This strategy deals with cyber crime 

 
3.2. 
in the context of two interrelated forms of 
criminal activity: 

 
•	 cyber-dependent crimes – crimes 
 

that can be committed only 
through the use of Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) 
devices, where the devices are both 
 
the tool for committing the crime, 
and the target of the crime (e.g. 
developing and propagating malware 
for financial gain, hacking to steal, 
 
damage, distort or destroy data 
and/or network or activity); and 

 
•	 cyber-enabled crimes – traditional 

crimes which can be increased in scale 
or reach by the use of computers, 
computer networks or other forms of 
ICT (such as cyber-enabled fraud and 
data theft). 

 

3.3.  Much of the most serious cyber 
crime – mainly fraud, theft and extortion – 
against the UK continues to be perpetrated 
predominantly by financially motivated 
Russian-language organised criminal 
groups (OCGs) in Eastern Europe, with 
many of the criminal marketplace services 
being hosted in these countries. However, 
the threat also emanates from other 
countries and regions, and from inside the 
UK itself, with emerging threats from South 
Asia and West Africa of increasing concern. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 3STRATEGIC CONTEXT18 

Even when key individuals 

3.4. 
 
responsible for the most damaging cyber 
criminal activities against the UK are 
identified, it is often difficult for the UK 
 
and international law enforcement 
 
agencies to prosecute them when they 
 
are located in jurisdictions with limited, 
 
or no, extradition arrangements. 

These OCGs are principally 

3.5. 
 
responsible for developing and deploying 
the increasingly advanced malware that 
infects the computers and networks of 
UK citizens, our industry and government. 
The impact is dispersed throughout 
the UK, but the cumulative effect is 
significant. These attacks are becoming 
increasingly aggressive and confrontational, 
as illustrated by the increasing use of 
ransomware, and threats of distributed 
denial of service (DDoS) for extortion. 

 

3.6.  Whilst OCGs may pose a significant 
threat to our collective prosperity and 
security, equally of concern is the 
continuing threat from acts of less 
sophisticated but widespread cyber crimes 
carried out against individuals or smaller 
organisations. 

Internet banking fraud, which covers 
fraudulent payments taken from a 
customer’s bank account using the 
internet banking channel, rose by 64% 
to £133.5m in 2015. The number of 
cases increased at a lower rate of 23%, 
 
which Financial Fraud Action UK said 
is evidence of the growing trend for 
criminals to target business and high­
net-worth customers. 

 

States and state-sponsored threats 

 

3.7.  We regularly see attempts by states 
and state-sponsored groups to penetrate 
UK networks for political, diplomatic, 
technological, commercial and strategic 
advantage, with a principal focus on the 
government, defence, finance, energy and 
telecommunications sectors. 

The capacity and impact of 
 

3.8. 
 
these state cyber programmes varies. 
 
The most advanced nations continue 
to improve their capabilities at pace, 
integrating encryption and anonymisation 
services into their tools in order to remain 
covert. While they have the technical 
capability to deploy sophisticated attacks, 
they can often achieve their aims using 
basic tools and techniques against 
vulnerable targets because the defences 
 
of their victims are poor. 

 

3.9.  Only a handful of states have the 
technical capabilities to pose a serious 
threat to the UK’s overall security and 
prosperity. But many other states 
are developing sophisticated cyber 
programmes that could pose a threat 
to UK interests in the near future. Many 
states seeking to develop cyber espionage 
capability can purchase computer network 
exploitation tools ‘off the shelf’ and 
repurpose these to conduct espionage. 

 

3.10.  Beyond the espionage threat, a small 
 
number of hostile foreign threat actors have 
 
developed and deployed offensive cyber 
 
capabilities, including destructive ones. 
 
These capabilities threaten the security of 
 
the UK’s critical national infrastructure and 
 
industrial control systems. Some states 
 
may use these capabilities in contravention 
 
of international law in the belief that 
 
they can do so with relative impunity, 
 
encouraging others to follow suit. Whilst 
 
destructive attacks around the world remain 
 
rare, they are rising in number and impact.

Terrorists 

Hacktivists 

 

3.11.  Terrorist groups continue to aspire 
to conduct damaging cyber activity against 
the UK and its interests. The current 
technical capability of terrorists is judged 
to be low. Nonetheless the impact of even 
low-capability activity against the UK to 
date has been disproportionately high: 
simple defacements and doxing activity 
(where hacked personal details are ‘leaked’ 
online) enable terrorist groups and their 
supporters to attract media attention and 
intimidate their victims. 

“Terrorists using the Internet for 
their purposes does not equal cyber­
terrorism. However, by increasingly 
engaging in cyber-space, and given the 
availability of cyber-crime as a service, 
 
one can assume that they would be in 
the position to launch cyber attacks” 

ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 

 

3.12.  The current assessment is that 
physical, rather than cyber, terrorist attacks 
will remain the priority for terrorist groups 
for the immediate future. As an increasingly 
computer-literate generation engages 
in extremism, potentially exchanging 
enhanced technical skills, we envisage 
a greater volume of low-sophistication 
(defacement or DDoS) disruptive activity 
against the UK. The potential for a number 
of skilled extremist lone actors to emerge 
will also increase, as will the risk that a 
terrorist organisation will seek to enlist an 
established insider. Terrorists will likely 
use any cyber capability to achieve the 
maximum effect possible. Thus, even a 
moderate increase in terrorist capability 
may constitute a significant threat to the 
 
UK and its interests. 

 

3.13.  Hacktivist groups are decentralised 
and issue-orientated. They form and select 
their targets in response to perceived 
grievances, introducing a vigilante quality 
to many of their acts. While the majority 
of hacktivist cyber activity is disruptive in 
nature (website defacement or DDoS), more 
able hacktivists have been able to inflict 
greater and lasting damage on their victims. 

INSIDERS 

Insider threats remain a cyber risk to 
organisations in the UK. Malicious 
insiders, who are trusted employees 
of an organisation and have access 
to critical systems and data, pose 
the greatest threat. They can cause 
financial and reputational damage 
through the theft of sensitive data and 
intellectual property. They can also pose 
a destructive cyber threat if they use 
their privileged knowledge, or access, to 
facilitate, or launch, an attack to disrupt 
or degrade critical services on the 
network of their organisations, or wipe 
data from the network. 

Of equal concern are those insiders 
or employees who accidentally cause 
cyber harm through inadvertent 
clicking on a phishing email, plugging 
an infected USB into a computer, 
or ignoring security procedures and 
downloading unsafe content from the 
Internet. Whilst they have no intention 
of deliberately harming the organisation, 
their privileged access to systems and 
data mean their actions can cause just 
as much damage as a malicious insider. 
These individuals are often the victims of 
social engineering – they can unwittingly 
provide access to the networks of their 
organisation or carry out instructions in 
good faith that benefit the fraudster. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 3STRATEGIC CONTEXT20 

The overall cyber risk to an organisation 
from insider threats is not just about 
unauthorised access to information 
systems and their content. The physical 
security controls protecting those 
systems from inappropriate access, or 
removal of sensitive data or proprietary 
information on different forms of media, 
are equally important. Similarly, a robust 
personnel security culture that is alive 
to the threat posed by disaffected 
employees, fraud in the workforce 
and industrial and other forms of 
espionage is an important element in a 
comprehensive approach to security. 

‘Script Kiddies’ 

 

3.14.  So-called ‘script kiddies’ – generally 
less skilled individuals who use scripts 
or programmes developed by others to 
conduct cyber attacks – are not assessed 
as posing a substantive threat to the 
wider economy or society. But they do 
have access to hacking guides, resources 
and tools on the Internet. Due to the 
vulnerabilities found in internet-facing 
systems used by many organisations, the 
actions of ‘script kiddies’ can, in some 
cases, have a disproportionately damaging 
impact on an affected organisation. 

CASE STUDY 1: TALKTALK 
COMPROMISE 

On 21 October 2015, UK 
telecommunications provider TalkTalk 
reported a successful cyber attack and 
a possible breach of customer data. 
Subsequent investigation determined 
that a database containing customer 
details had been accessed via public-
facing internet servers, with the records 
of approximately 157,000 customers at 
risk, including names, addresses and 
bank account details. 

On the same day, several TalkTalk 
employees received an email with a 
ransom demand for payment in Bitcoins. 
The attackers detailed the structure of 
the database as apparent proof that it 
had been accessed. 

TalkTalk’s report of the breach helped 
the police, supported by specialists at 
the National Crime Agency, to arrest the 
main suspects, all based in the UK, in 
October and November 2015. 

The attack demonstrates that, even 
within large cyber-aware organisations, 
vulnerabilities can persist. Their 
exploitation can have a disproportionate 
effect in terms of reputational damage 
and operational disruption, and this 
incident generated substantial media 
attention. TalkTalk’s rapid reporting of 
 
the breach enabled law enforcement 
 
to respond in a timely manner, and 
both the public and government to 
mitigate the potential loss of sensitive 
data. The incident cost TalkTalk an 
estimated £60m and the loss of 95,000 
customers, as well as a sharp drop in 
their share price.

CASE STUDY 2: ATTACK ON BANGLADESH 
BANK’S SWIFT SYSTEM 

The Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) 
provides a network that enables financial 
institutions worldwide to send and receive 
information about financial transactions 
in a secure way. As SWIFT sends 
payment orders which must be settled 
by correspondent accounts that the 
institutions have with each other, there 
has long been concern over any potential 
for this process to be compromised by 
cyber criminals or other malicious actors, 
seeking to inject illegitimate payment 
orders into the system or, in a worst case 
scenario, seeking to disable or disrupt the 
functionality of the SWIFT network itself. 

In early February 2016, an attacker 
 
accessed the SWIFT payment system 
 
of the Bangladesh Bank and instructed 
 
the New York Federal Reserve bank to 
 
transfer money from Bangladesh Bank’s 
 
account to accounts in the Philippines. 
 
The attempted fraud was US$951 million. 
 
30 transactions, worth US$850 million, 
 
were prevented by the banking system; 
 
however, five transactions worth US$101 
 
million went through. US$20 million, traced 
 
to Sri Lanka, has since been recovered. 
 
The remaining US$81 million transferred 
 
to the Philippines was laundered through 
 
casinos and some of the funds were then 
 
forwarded to Hong Kong. 

The forensic investigation launched 
 
by Bangladesh Bank discovered that 
 
malware had been installed on the bank’s 
 
systems and had been used to gather 
 
intelligence on the procedures used 
 
by the bank for international payments 
 
and fund transfers. Further analysis by 
 
BAE Systems of the malware linked 
 
to the attack uncovered sophisticated 
 
functionality for interacting with the local 
 

SWIFT Alliance Access software running in 
 
the Bangladesh Bank infrastructure. BAE 
 
concluded ‘that criminals are conducting 
 
more and more sophisticated attacks 
 
against victim organisations, particularly in 
 
the area of network intrusions’. 

CASE STUDY 3: UKRAINE POWER GRID 
ATTACK 

A cyber attack on western Ukrainian 
electricity distribution companies 
Prykarpattya Oblenergo and Kyiv 
Oblenergo on 23 December 2015 
caused a major power outage, with 
disruption to over 50 substations on 
the distribution networks. The region 
reportedly experienced a blackout for 
several hours and many other customers 
and areas sustained lesser disruptions to 
their power supplies, affecting more than 
220,000 consumers. 

Use of the BlackEnergy3 malware has 
been blamed by some for the attack, after 
samples were identified on the network. 
At least six months before the attack, 
attackers had sent phishing emails to the 
offices of power utility companies in the 
Ukraine containing malicious Microsoft 
Office documents. However, the malware 
was not likely to have been responsible 
for opening the circuit breakers which 
resulted in the outage. It is probable that 
the malware enabled the attackers to 
gather credentials that allowed them to 
gain direct remote control of aspects of 
the network, which would subsequently 
enable them to trigger the outage. 

This Ukraine incident is the first confirmed 
 
instance of a disruptive cyber attack on an 
 
electricity network. Instances such as this 
 
further demonstrate the need for good cyber 
 
security practices across all of our Critical 
 
National Infrastructure (CNI) to prevent 
 
similar incidents occurring in the UK. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 3STRATEGIC CONTEXT22 

VULNERABILITIES 

An expanding range of devices 

 

3.15.  When the last National Cyber 
Security Strategy was published in 
2011, most people conceived of cyber 
security through the prism of protecting 
devices such as their desktop computer 
or laptop. Since then the Internet has 
become increasingly integrated into our 
daily lives in ways we are largely oblivious 
to. The ‘Internet of Things’ creates new 
opportunities for exploitation and increases 
the potential impact of attacks which have 
the potential to cause physical damage, 
injury to persons and, in a worst case 
scenario, death. 

 

3.16.  The rapid implementation of 
connectivity in industrial control processes 
in critical systems, across a wide range 
of industries such as energy, mining, 
agriculture and aviation, has created 
the Industrial Internet of Things. This is 
simultaneously opening up the possibility of 
devices and processes, which were never 
vulnerable to such interference in the past, 
being hacked and tampered with, with 
potentially disastrous consequences. 

 

3.17.  Therefore, we are no longer just 
vulnerable to cyber harms caused by the 
lack of cyber security on our own devices 
but by threats to the interconnected 
systems that are fundamental to our 
society, health and welfare. 

Poor cyber hygiene and compliance 

 

3.18.  Awareness of technical 
vulnerabilities in software and networks, 
and the need for cyber hygiene in the UK, 
has undoubtedly increased over the past 
five years. This is in part a consequence 
 
of initiatives like the Government’s 
 

‘10 Steps to Cyber Security’, but also due 
to the increased public profile of major 
cyber incidents affecting governments 
and corporations. Cyber attacks are not 
necessarily sophisticated or inevitable 
and are often the result of exploited – but 
easily rectifiable and, often, preventable – 
vulnerabilities. In most cases, it continues 
to be the vulnerability of the victim, rather 
than the ingenuity of the attacker, that is 
the deciding factor in the success of a 
cyber attack. Businesses and organisations 
decide on where and how to invest in 
cyber security based on a cost-benefit 
assessment, but they are ultimately liable 
for the security of their data and systems. 
Only by balancing the risk to their critical 
systems and sensitive data from cyber 
attacks, with sufficient investment in 
people, technology and governance, 
will businesses reduce their exposure to 
potential cyber harm. 

“There is no conceivable information 
security system that can stop one 
person out of a hundred opening a 
phishing email, and that can be all 
 
it takes.” 

Ciaran Martin, Director General for 
Cyber Security, GCHQ – June 2015 

Insufficient training and skills 

 We lack the skills and 
 

3.19.
 
knowledge to meet our cyber security 
needs across both the public and private 
 
sector. In businesses, many staff 
 
members are not cyber security 
aware and do not understand their 
 
responsibilities in this regard, partially 
due to a lack of formal training. The public 
is also insufficiently cyber aware. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 3 STRATEGIC CONTEXT23 

“Just under a fifth of businesses had 
their staff take part in cyber security 
training in the past year.” 
Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2016. 

 

3.20.  We also need to develop the 
specialist skills and capabilities that will 
allow us to keep pace with rapidly evolving 
technology and manage the associated 
cyber risks. This skills gap represents a 
national vulnerability that must be resolved. 

Legacy and unpatched systems 

 

3.21.  Many organisations in the UK will 
continue to use vulnerable legacy systems 
until their next IT upgrade. Software on 
these systems will often rely on older, 
unpatched versions. These older versions 
often suffer from vulnerabilities that 
attackers look for and have the tools to 
exploit. An additional issue is the use 
by some organisations of unsupported 
software, for which patching regimes do 
not exist. 

“We recently analysed 115,000 Cisco 
devices on the Internet and across 
customer environments as a way to 
bring attention to the security risks 
that aging infrastructure – and lack 
of attention to patching vulnerabilities 
present… We found that 106,000 
of the 115,000 devices had known 
vulnerabilities in the software they 
were running.” 

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report 

Availability of hacking resources 

 

3.22.  The ready availability of hacking 
information and user-friendly hacking tools 
on the Internet is enabling those who want 
to develop a hacking capability to do so. 
The information hackers need in order to 
compromise victims successfully is often 
openly accessible and can be harvested 
quickly. Everyone, from the living room 
 
to the boardroom, needs to be aware of 
the extent of exposure of their personal 
details and systems on the Internet, and 
the degree to which that could leave them 
vulnerable to malicious cyber exploitation. 

“99.9% of exploited vulnerabilities 
were compromised more than a year 
after the vulnerability was published.”

CONCLUSIONS 

 

3.23.  The UK has pursued policies and 
established institutions that have enhanced 
our defences and mitigated some of the 
threat we face in cyberspace. 

 

3.24.  However, we are not yet ahead of the 
 
threat. The types of malicious cyber actors 
 
we must contend with, and their motivations, 
 
have largely endured, even as the volume of 
 
malware and the numbers of such malicious 
 
actors has grown rapidly. The capability of 
 
our most technically proficient adversaries, 
 
namely a select number of states and elite 
 
cyber criminals, has grown. Our collective 
 
challenge is to ensure our defences are 
 
evolved and agile enough to counter them, 
 
to reduce the ability of malicious actors to 
 
attack us and to address the root causes of 
 
the vulnerabilities outlined above.

4. OUR NATIONAL 

 
RESPONSE 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4 OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE25 

 
4.1. 
To mitigate the multiple threats 
we face and safeguard our interests in 
cyberspace, we need a strategic approach 
that underpins all our collective and 
individual actions in the digital domain over 
the next five years. This section sets out 
our vision and strategic approach. 

OUR VISION 

 

4.2.  Our vision for 2021 is that 
 
the UK is secure and resilient to cyber 
threats, prosperous and confident in 
 
the digital world. 

To realise this vision, we will work to 

4.3. 
 
achieve the following objectives: 

•	 DEFEND We have the 
 

means to defend the UK 
against evolving cyber 
threats, to respond 
effectively to incidents, 
and to ensure UK networks, data and 
systems are protected and resilient. 
Citizens, businesses and the public 
sector have the knowledge and ability 
to defend themselves. 

•	 DETER The UK will be a 
 

hard target for all forms of 
aggression in cyberspace. 
We detect, understand, 
investigate and disrupt 
hostile action taken against us, 
pursuing and prosecuting offenders. 
We have the means to take offensive 
action in cyberspace, should we 
choose to do so. 

•	 DEVELOP We have 
 

an innovative, growing 
cyber security industry, 
underpinned by world-
leading scientific 
research and development. We have 
a self-sustaining pipeline of talent 
providing the skills to meet our national 

needs across the public and private 
 
sectors. Our cutting-edge analysis 
and expertise will enable the UK to 
 
meet and overcome future threats 
and challenges. 

 

4.4.  Underpinning these objectives, we 
will pursue INTERNATIONAL ACTION 
 
and exert our influence by investing in 
partnerships. We will shape the global 
 
evolution of cyberspace in a manner 
that advances our wider economic and 
security interests. 

PRINCIPLES 

In working towards these objectives, 

4.5 
 
the Government will apply the following 
principles: 

•	 our actions and policies will be driven 
 
by the need to both protect our people 
and enhance our prosperity; 

•	 we will treat a cyber attack on the UK 
 

as seriously as we would an equivalent 
conventional attack and we will defend 
ourselves as necessary; 

•	 we will act in accordance with national 
 
and international law and expect others 
to do the same; 

•	 we will rigorously protect and promote 
 

our core values. These include 
democracy; the rule of law; liberty; 
open and accountable governments 
and institutions; human rights; and 
freedom of expression; 

•	 we will preserve and protect UK 

 

citizens’ privacy;
 

•	 we will work in partnership. Only 
 

by working with the Devolved 
Administrations, all parts of the public 
sector, businesses, institutions, and the 
individual citizen, can we successfully 
secure the UK in cyberspace; 
•	 the Government will meet its 
 
responsibilities and lead the 
national response, but businesses, 
organisations and individual citizens 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE26 

have a responsibility to take reasonable 
steps to protect themselves online and 
ensure they are resilient and able to 
continue operating in the event of an 
incident; 

to safeguard not only our hardware – our 
smart phones and other devices – but also 
the data, software and systems that afford 
us freedom, flexibility and convenience in 
our private and professional lives. 

•	 responsibility for the security of 
 
organisations across the public 
sector, including cyber security 
and the protection of online data 
and services, lies with respective 
Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and 
Management Boards; 

•	 we will not accept significant risk being 
 
posed to the public and the country as 
a whole as a result of businesses and 
organisations failing to take the steps 
needed to manage cyber threats; 

•	 we will work closely with those 
 

countries that share our views and 
with whom our security overlaps, 
recognising that cyber threats know 
no borders. We will also work broadly 
across the range of international 
partners to influence the wider 
community, acknowledging the value 
of broad coalitions; and 

•	 to ensure Government interventions are 
 
having a substantive impact on overall 
national cyber security and resilience, 
we will seek to define, analyse and 
present data which measures the state 
of our collective cyber security and our 
success in meeting our strategic goals. 

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

Securing the national cyberspace will 

4.6. 
 
require a collective effort. Each and every 
one of us has an important part to play. 

Individuals 

Businesses and organisations 

 

4.8.  Businesses, public and private 
sector organisations and other institutions 
hold personal data, provide services, 
 
and operate systems in the digital 
 
domain. The connectivity of this 
 
information has revolutionised their 
operations. But with this technological 
transformation comes the responsibility 
to safeguard the assets which they hold, 
maintain the services they provide, and 
incorporate the appropriate level of 
 
security into the products they sell. The 
citizen and consumer, and society at large, 
look to businesses and organisations to 
take all reasonable steps to protect their 
personal data, and build resilience – the 
ability to withstand and recover – into the 
systems and structures on which they 
depend. Businesses and organisations 
must also understand that, if they are the 
victim of a cyber attack, they are liable for 
the consequences. 

Government 

The primary duty of the Government 

 
4.9. 
is to defend the country from attacks 
by other states, to protect citizens and 
the economy from harm, and to set the 
domestic and international framework 
to protect our interests, safeguard 
fundamental rights, and bring criminals to 
justice. 

As citizens, employees and 

4.7. 
 
consumers, we take practical steps to 
secure the assets we value in the physical 
world. In the virtual world, we must do the 
same. That means fulfilling our personal 
responsibility to take all reasonable steps 

 

4.10.  As the holder of significant data and 
a provider of services, the Government 
takes stringent measures to provide 
safeguards for its information assets. 
The Government also has an important 
responsibility to advise and inform citizens 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4 OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE27 

and organisations what they need to do 
to protect themselves online, and where 
necessary, set the standards we expect key 
companies and organisations to meet. 

 

4.11.  Although key sectors of our 
economy are in private hands, the 
Government is ultimately responsible for 
assuring their national resilience and, with 
its partners across the administration, the 
maintenance of essential services and 
functions across the whole of government. 

Driving change: the role of the market 

 

4.12.  The 2011 Strategy and National 
Cyber Security Programme sought to drive 
outcomes and increase capacity in both 
the public and private sector by looking to 
the market to drive the right behaviours. 
We expected commercial pressures 
and government-instigated incentives to 
ensure adequate business investment in 
appropriate cyber security, to stimulate a 
flow of investment into our industry, and to 
encourage an adequate pipeline of skills 
into the sector. 

 

4.13.  Much has been achieved. Across 
the economy and wider society, awareness 
of the risk and of the actions required to 
mitigate cyber risk have increased over 
the last five years. But the combination 
of market forces and government 
encouragement has not been sufficient in 
itself to secure our long-term interests in 
cyberspace at the pace required. Too many 
networks, including in critical sectors, are 
still insecure. The market is not valuing, 
and therefore not managing, cyber risk 
correctly. Too many organisations are still 
suffering breaches at even the most basic 
level. Too few investors are willing to risk 
supporting entrepreneurs in the sector. Too 
few graduates and others with the right 
skills are emerging from the education and 
training system. 

 

4.14.  The market still has a role to 
play and in the longer term will deliver 
greater impact than the Government 
ever can. However, the immediacy of the 
threat facing the UK and the expanding 
vulnerabilities of our digitalised environment 
call for greater action in the short term from 
the Government. 

Driving change: expanded role for the 
Government 

 

4.15.  The Government must therefore set 
the pace in meeting the country’s national 
cyber security needs. Only Government 
can draw on the intelligence and other 
assets required to defend the country 
from the most sophisticated threats. 
Only Government can drive cooperation 
across the public and private sectors and 
ensure information is shared between the 
two. Government has a leading role, in 
consultation with industry, in defining what 
good cyber security looks like and ensuring 
it is implemented. 

 

4.16.  The Government will bring about 
a significant improvement in our national 
cyber security over the next five years. This 
ambitious and transformational programme 
will focus on the following four broad areas: 

•	 Levers and incentives. The 
 

Government will invest to maximise 
 
the potential of a truly innovative 
UK cyber sector. We will do this by 
supporting start-ups and investing 
in innovation. We will also seek to 
identify and bring on talent earlier in the 
education system and develop clearer 
routes into a profession that needs 
better definition. The Government will 
also make use of all available levers, 
including the forthcoming General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR), to drive 
up standards of cyber security across 
the economy, including, if required, 
through regulation. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE“Given the industrial-scale theft 
of intellectual property from our 
companies and universities, as well as 
the numerous phishing and malware 
scams that waste time and money, the 
National Cyber Security Centre shows 
that the UK is focusing its efforts to 
combat the threats that exist online.” 

 
Robert Hannigan, Director GCHQ, 
March 2016 

 

4.17.  Delivering these changes to our 
cyber security and resilience will require 
additional resources. In the Strategic 
Defence and Security Review 2015, the 
Government set aside £1.9 billion over the 
five years of the strategy to deliver these 
commitments and objectives. 

28 

•	 Expanded intelligence and law 
 
 

enforcement focus on the threat. 
The intelligence agencies, the Ministry 
 
of Defence, the police and the National 
 
Crime Agency, in coordination with 
 
international partner agencies, will expand 
 
their efforts to identify, anticipate and 
 
disrupt hostile cyber activities by foreign 
 
actors, cyber criminals and terrorists. This 
 
will improve their intelligence collection 
 
and exploitation, with the aim of obtaining 
 
pre-emptive intelligence on the intent and 
 
capabilities of our adversaries. 

•	 Development and deployment of 
 
 

technology in partnership with industry, 
 
including Active Cyber Defence 
 
measures, to deepen our understanding 
 
of the threat, to strengthen the security 
 
of the UK public and private sector 
 
systems and networks in the face of that 
 
threat, and to disrupt malicious activity. 

•	 National Cyber Security Centre 
 
 

(NCSC). The Government has 
 
established a single, central body 
 
for cyber security at a national level. 
 
This body will manage national cyber 
 
incidents, provide an authoritative 
 
voice and centre of expertise on cyber 
 
security, and deliver tailored support 
 
and advice to departments, the 
 
Devolved Administrations, regulators 
 
and businesses. The NCSC will analyse, 
 
detect and understand cyber threats, 
 
and will also provide its cyber security 
 
expertise to support the Government’s 
 
efforts to foster innovation, support a 
 
thriving cyber security industry, and 
 
stimulate the development of cyber 
 
security skills. Uniquely for such a public-
facing body, its parent body is GCHQ 
 
and it can therefore draw on the world-
class expertise and sensitive capabilities 
 
of that organisation, improving the 
 
support it will be able to provide to the 
 
economy and society more widely. It will 
 
remain the responsibility of government 
 
departments to ensure they effectively 
 
implement this cyber security advice. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4 OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE29 

THE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY CENTRE 

The National Cyber Security Centre 
(NCSC) launched on 1 October 2016. The 
NCSC provides a unique opportunity to 
build effective cyber security partnerships 
between government, industry and the 
public to ensure that the UK is safer 
online. It will provide cyber incident 
response and be the UK’s authoritative 
voice on cyber security. For the first time, 
key sectors will be able to engage directly 
with NCSC staff to get the best possible 
advice and support on securing networks 
and systems from cyber threats. 

The NCSC provides: 

•	 a unified source of advice for 
 

the Government’s cyber security 
threat intelligence and information 
assurance; 

•	 the strong public face of the 
 

Government’s action against cyber 
threats – working hand in hand with 
industry, academia and international 
partners to keep the UK protected 
against cyber attack; and 

•	 a public-facing organisation with 
 

reach back into GCHQ to draw on 
necessarily secret intelligence and 
world-class technical expertise. 

There will be a phased approach to 
building the NCSC’s capabilities over the 
lifetime of this strategy. It brings together 

the capabilities already developed by 
CESG – the information security arm of 
GCHQ – the Centre for the Protection of 
National Infrastructure (CPNI), CERT-UK 
(Computer Emergency Response Team) 
and the Centre for Cyber Assessment 
(CCA), enabling us to build on the best 
of what we already have, whilst greatly 
simplifying the former arrangements. Its 
initial focus will be: 

•	 a world class incident management 
 
capability to respond to and reduce 
the harm from cyber incidents – 
 
from those affecting single 
organisations through to national, 
large scale attacks; 

•	 providing communications on how 
 

organisations in the public and private 
sector can deal with cyber security 
issues, facilitating the sharing of 
cyber threat information; and 
•	 continuing to provide expert
 
 
 

sectoral advice to Government 

and critical sectors like 

telecommunications, energy and 

finance, and providing cyber
 
 
security advice across the UK.
 

The NCSC offers an effective means for 
the Government to deliver many elements 
of this strategy. We recognise that, as the 
NCSC grows, its focus and capabilities 
will need to adapt to new challenges and 
lessons learned.

IMPLEMENTATION 
PLAN 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4 OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE31 

Our goals for the country’s cyber security over the next five 
years are rightly ambitious. To achieve them will require 
us to act with consequence and determination across the 
digital landscape. Activity to deliver the Government’s vision 
will advance the three primary objectives of the strategy: 
to DEFEND our cyberspace, to DETER our adversaries and 
to DEVELOP our capabilities, all underpinned by effective 
INTERNATIONAL ACTION. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 4OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE32
 

5. DEFEND 

 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND33 

 

5.0.1.  The DEFEND elements of this 
strategy aim to ensure that UK networks, 
data and systems in the public, commercial 
and private spheres are resilient to and 
protected from cyber attack. It will never 
be possible to stop every cyber attack, just 
as it is not possible to stop every crime. 
However, together with citizens, education 
providers, academia, businesses and other 
governments, the UK can build layers of 
defence that will significantly reduce our 
exposure to cyber incidents, protect our 
most precious assets, and allow us all to 
operate successfully and prosperously in 
cyberspace. Acting to promote cooperation 
between states and good cyber security 
practice is also in the interest of our 
collective security. 

 

5.0.2.  The Government will implement 
measures to ensure that citizens, 
businesses, public and private sector 
organisations and institutions have 
access to the right information to defend 
themselves. The National Cyber Security 
Centre provides a unified source of advice 
in government for threat intelligence 
and information assurance, ensuring 
that we can offer tailored guidance for 
cyber defence and respond quickly and 
effectively to major incidents in cyberspace. 
The Government will work with industry 
and international partners to define what 
good cyber security looks like for public 
and private sectors, for our most important 
systems and services, and for the economy 
as a whole. We will build security by 
default into all new government and critical 
systems. Law enforcement agencies will 
collaborate closely with industry and the 
National Cyber Security Centre to provide 
dynamic criminal threat intelligence with 
 
which industry can better defend itself, 
and to promote protective security advice 
and standards. 

5.1.  ACTIVE CYBER DEFENCE 

 

 

5.1.1.  Active Cyber Defence (ACD) is the 
 
principle of implementing security measures 
 
to strengthen a network or system to 
 
make it more robust against attack. In a 
 
commercial context, Active Cyber Defence 
 
normally refers to cyber security analysts 
 
developing an understanding of the threats 
 
to their networks, and then devising and 
 
implementing measures to proactively 
 
combat, or defend, against those threats. In 
 
 
the context of this strategy, the Government 
has chosen to apply the same principle on 
 
a larger scale: the Government will use its 
 
unique expertise, capabilities and influence 
 
to bring about a step-change in national 
 
cyber security to respond to cyber threats. 
 
The ‘network’ we are attempting to defend 
 
is the entire UK cyberspace. The activities 
 
proposed represent a defensive action plan, 
 
drawing on the expertise of NCSC as the 
 
National Technical Authority to respond to 
 
cyber threats to the UK at a macro level. 

Objectives 

In undertaking ACD, the Government 

5.1.2. 
 
aims to: 

•	 make the UK a much harder target 
 

for state sponsored actors and cyber 
criminals by increasing the resilience of 
UK networks; 

•	 defeat the vast majority of high-
 

volume/low-sophistication malware 
activity on UK networks by blocking 
malware communications between 
hackers and their victims; 

•	 evolve and increase the scope and 
 

scale of Government’s capabilities to 
disrupt serious state sponsored and 
cyber criminal threats; 

•	 secure our internet and 

 

telecommunications traffic from 

hijacking by malicious actors;
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND34 

•	 harden the UK’s critical infrastructure 
 

and citizen-facing services against 
cyber threats; and 

•	 disrupt the business model of attackers 
 

of every type, to demotivate them and 
to reduce the harm that their attacks 
can cause. 

 

5.1.4.  Where possible, these initiatives will 
be delivered with or through partnerships 
with industry. For many, industry will be 
designing and leading implementation, 
 
with the Government’s critical contribution 
being expert support, advice and 
 
thought-leadership. 

Approach 

In pursuit of these aims, the 

5.1.3. 
 
Government will: 

 

5.1.5.  The Government will also undertake 
specific actions to implement these 
measures, which will include: 

•	 work with industry, especially 
 

Communications Service Providers 
(CSPs), to make it significantly harder 
to attack UK internet services and 
users, and greatly reduce the prospect 
of attacks having a sustained impact 
on the UK. This will include tackling 
phishing, blocking malicious domains 
and IP addresses, and other steps to 
disrupt malware attacks. It will also 
include measures to secure the UK’s 
telecommunications and internet 
routing infrastructure; 

•	 increase the scale and development 
 
 

of GCHQ, Ministry of Defence and 
 
NCA capabilities to disrupt the most 
serious cyber threats to the 
 
UK, including campaigns by 
sophisticated cyber criminals and 
hostile foreign actors; and 

•	 better protect government systems 
 

and networks, help industry build 
greater security into the CNI supply 
chain, make the software ecosystem 
in the UK more secure, and provide 
automated protections for government 
online services to the citizen. 

•	 working with CSPs to block malware 
 
attacks. We will do this by restricting 
access to specific domains or web 
sites that are known sources of 
malware. This is known as Domain 
Name System (DNS) blocking / filtering; 

•	 preventing phishing activity that 
 

relies on domain ‘spoofing’ (where an 
email appears to be from a specific 
sender, such as a bank or government 
department, but is actually fraudulent) 
by deploying an email verification 
system on government networks as 
standard and encouraging industry to 
do likewise; 

•	 promoting security best practice 
 

through multi-stakeholder internet 
governance organisations such as 
the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
which coordinates the domain name 
system), the Internet Engineering 
Task Force (IETF) and the European 
Regional Internet Registry (RIPE) and 
engagement with stakeholders in the 
UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF); 

•	 working with law enforcement channels 
 

in order to protect UK citizens from 
being targeted in cyber attacks from 
unprotected infrastructure overseas; 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND35 

 

5.2.	  BUILDING A MORE SECURE 
 

INTERNET 

 

5.2.1.  Changing technology provides us 
with the opportunity to significantly reduce 
the ability of our adversaries to conduct 
cyber crime in the UK by ensuring that 
future online products and services coming 
into use are ‘secure by default’. That means 
ensuring that the security controls built 
into the software and hardware we use 
are activated as a default setting by the 
manufacturer so that the user experiences 
the maximum security offered to them, 
unless they actively choose to turn it off. 
The challenge is to effect transformative 
change in a way that supports the end 
user and offers a commercially viable, but 
secure, product or service – all within the 
context of maintaining the free and open 
nature of the Internet. 

 

“Internet-connected things are 
multiplying rapidly. We saw many 
proof-of-concept and real world 
attacks in 2015, identifying serious 
vulnerabilities in cars, medical devices 
and more. Manufacturers need to 
prioritise security to reduce the risk 
 
of serious personal, economic and 
social consequences.” 

Symantec 2016 Internet Security 
 
Threat Report 

 
•	 working towards the implementation 

of controls to secure the routing 
of internet traffic for government 
departments to ensure that it cannot 
be illegitimately re-routed by malicious 
actors; and 

•	 investing in programmes in the Ministry 
 

of Defence, the NCA and GCHQ that 
will enhance the capabilities of these 
organisations to respond to, and 
disrupt, serious state-sponsored and 
criminal cyber activity targeting UK 
networks. 

We will develop these technical 
interventions as threats evolve to ensure 
that UK citizens and businesses are 
protected by default from the majority of 
large-scale commodity cyber attacks. 

Measuring success 

 

5.1.6.  The Government will measure its 
success in establishing effective ACD 
 
by assessing progress towards the 
following outcomes: 

•	 the UK is harder to ‘phish’, because we 
 

have large-scale defences against the 
use of malicious domains, more active 
anti-phishing protection at scale and 
it is much harder to use other forms 
of communication, such as ‘vishing’ 
and SMS spoofing, to conduct social 
engineering attacks; 

•	 a far larger proportion of malware 
 

communications and technical 
artefacts associated with cyber attacks 
and exploitation are being blocked; 

•	 the UK’s internet and 
 

telecommunications traffic is 
significantly less vulnerable to rerouting 
by malicious actors; 

•	 GCHQ, the Armed Forces’ and NCA 
 

capabilities to respond to serious state-
sponsored and criminal threats have 
significantly increased. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND36 

 

5.2.2.  The Government is well-placed 
to take a lead role in exploring those 
new technologies that will better protect 
our own systems, help industry build 
greater security into the supply chain, 
secure the software ecosystem and 
provide automated protections to citizens 
accessing government services online. 
The Government must test and implement 
new technologies that provide automated 
protection for government online products 
and services. Where possible, similar 
technologies should be offered to the 
private sector and the citizen. 

Objective 

  

5.2.3.  The majority of online products 
and services coming into use become 
‘secure by default’ by 2021. Consumers 
will be empowered to choose products 
and services that have built-in security as 
a default setting. Individuals can switch off 
these settings if they choose to do so but 
those consumers who wish to engage in 
cyberspace in the most secure way will be 
automatically protected. 

Our approach 

5.2.4.  We will pursue the following actions: 
 

 

•	 the Government will lead by example 
 

by running secure services on the 
Internet that do not rely on the Internet 
itself being secure; 

•	 the Government will explore options for 
 
 

collaboration with industry to develop 
 
cutting-edge ways to make hardware and 
 
software more ‘secure by default’; and 
 
•	 we will adopt challenging new cyber 
 
security technologies in government, 
encouraging Devolved Administrations 
to do likewise, in order to reduce 
perceived risks of adoption. This 
will provide proof of concept and 
demonstrate the security benefits of 
new technologies and approaches. 

It will also put security at the heart of 
new product development, eliminate 
opportunities for criminal exploitation 
and thereby protect the end user. 

5.2.5.  To do this we will: 

 

•	 continue to encourage hardware and 
 

software providers to sell products with 
security settings activated as default, 
requiring the user to actively disable 
these settings to make them insecure. 
Some vendors are already doing this, 
but some are not yet taking these 
necessary steps; 

•	 continue to develop an Internet 
 

Protocol (IP) reputation service to 
protect government digital services 
(this would allow online services to 
get information about an IP address 
connecting to them, helping the service 
make more informed risk management 
decisions in real time); 

•	 seek to install products on government 
 

networks that will provide assurance 
that software is running correctly, and 
not being maliciously interfered with; 
•	 look to expand beyond the GOV.UK 
 
 

domain into other digital services 
measures that notify users who are 
running out-of-date browsers; and 
•	 invest in technologies like Trusted 
 

Platform Modules (TPM) and emerging 
industry standards such as Fast 
Identity Online (FIDO), which do not rely 
on passwords for user authentication, 
but use the machine and other 
devices in the user’s possession to 
authenticate. The Government will test 
innovative authentication mechanisms 
to demonstrate what they can offer, 
both in terms of security and overall 
user experience. 

 

5.2.6.  The Government will also explore 
how to encourage the market by providing 
security ratings for new products, so that 
consumers have clear information on 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND37 

which products and services offer them 
the greatest security. The Government 
will also explore how to link these product 
ratings to new and existing regulators, and 
ways to warn consumers when they are 
about to take an action online that might 
compromise their security. 

Measuring success 

 

5.2.7.  The Government will measure 
 
its success in building a secure Internet 
 
by assessing progress towards the 
following outcomes: 

•	 the majority of commodity products and 
 
 
services available in the UK in 2021 are 
 
making the UK more secure because 
 
they have their default security settings 
 
enabled by default or have security 
 
integrated into their design; and 

•	 all government services provided 
 

at national, local and Devolved 
Administration level are trusted by the 
UK public because they have been 
implemented as securely as possible, 
and fraud levels are within acceptable 
risk parameters. 

5.3.  PROTECTING GOVERNMENT 

 

 

5.3.1.  The UK Government, Devolved 
 
Administrations and the wider public sector 
 
hold large quantities of sensitive data. They 
 
deliver essential services to the public and 
 
operate networks that are critical to national 
 
security and resilience. The Government’s 
 
systems underpin the functioning of our 
 
society. The modernisation of public 
 
sector services will continue to be the 
 
cornerstone of the UK’s Digital Strategy – 
 
the Government’s digital ambition is for the 
 
UK to be the world’s leading digital nation. 
 
To retain the trust of citizens in online public 
 
sector services and systems, data held 
 
by government must be protected and all 
 
branches of government must implement 
 
 
appropriate levels of cyber security in the 

face of continuous attempts by hostile 
 
actors to gain access to government and 
 
public sector networks and data. 
 
Objectives 

 

5.3.2.  We want to achieve the following 
outcomes: 

•	 citizens use government online services 
 

with confidence: they trust that their 
sensitive information is safe and, in 
turn, understand their responsibility to 
submit their sensitive information online 
in a secure manner; 

•	 the Government will set and adhere to 
 

the most appropriate cyber security 
standards, to ensure that all branches 
of government understand and meet 
their obligations to secure their 
networks, data and services; and 
•	 the Government’s critical assets, 

 

including those at the highest 

classification, are protected from
 
 
cyber attacks. 


Our approach 

 

5.3.3.  The UK Government will continue to 
move more of its services online so that the 
UK can become truly ‘digital by default’. 
The Government Digital Service (GDS), 
the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) and 
the NCSC will ensure that all new digital 
services built or procured by government 
are also ‘secure by default’. 

 

5.3.4.  The Government’s networks are 
 
highly complex and in many cases still 
incorporate legacy systems, as well as 
some commercially available software 
which is no longer supported by the 
vendor. We will ensure that there are no 
unmanaged risks from legacy systems and 
unsupported software. 

 

5.3.5.  We will improve government and 
wider public sector resilience to cyber 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND38 

attack. This means ensuring an accurate 
and up to date knowledge of all systems, 
data, and those who have access to them. 
The likelihood and impact of a cyber 
incident will be minimised by implementing 
best practice as set out by the NCSC. 
The Government will also ensure that it 
is able to respond effectively to cyber 
incidents through a programme of incident 
exercises and regular testing of government 
networks. We will invite Devolved 
Administrations and local authorities 
to participate in these exercises, as 
appropriate. Through automated scanning, 
we will ensure that we have a better 
knowledge of government’s online security 
status. 

 

5.3.6.  Cyber security is not just about 
technology. Almost all successful cyber 
attacks have a contributing human factor. 
We will therefore continue to invest in our 
people, to ensure that everyone who works 
in government has a sound awareness of 
cyber risk. We will develop specific cyber 
expertise in areas where the risks are 
heightened and ensure that we have the 
right processes in place to manage these 
risks effectively. 

 

5.3.7.  The NCSC will develop world-
leading cyber security guidance which will 
keep pace with the threat and development 
of new technologies. We will take steps to 
make sure government organisations have 
easy access to threat information to inform 
their understanding of their own cyber risks 
and take appropriate action. 

 

5.3.8.  We will continue to improve 
our highest classification networks to 
safeguard the Government’s most sensitive 
communications. 

 

5.3.9.  Health and care systems pose unique 
 
challenges in the context of cyber security. 
 
The sector employs around 1.6 million 
 
people in over 40,000 organisations, each 
 

with vastly differing information security 
 
resources and capability. The National Data 
 
Guardian for Health and Care has set new 
 
data security standards for the health and 
 
social care systems in England, alongside 
 
a new data consent/opt-out model for 
 
patients. The Government will work with 
 
health and social care organisations to 
 
implement these standards. 

“Britain is a world leader in cyber 
 
security, but with growing threats, 
this new Cyber Security Operations 
Centre will ensure our Armed forces 
continue to operate securely. Our 
increasing defence budget means that 
we can stay ahead of our adversaries 
in cyberspace while also investing in 
conventional capabilities” 

The Rt Hon Michael Fallon MP, 
 
Defence Secretary, April 2016 

 

 

5.3.10.  Cyber security is vital to our defence. 
 
Our Armed Forces depend on information 
 
 
and communications systems, both in the 
UK and on operations around the world. The 
 
infrastructure and personnel of the Ministry 
 
of Defence (MoD) are prominent targets. 
 
Defence systems are regularly targeted by 
 
criminals, foreign intelligence services and 
 
other malicious actors seeking to exploit 
 
personnel, disrupt business and operations, 
 
and corrupt and steal information. We 
 
will enhance cyber threat awareness, 
 
detection, and reaction functions, through 
 
the development of a Cyber Security 
 
Operations Centre (CSOC) that uses state-
of-the-art defensive cyber capabilities to 
 
 
protect the MoD’s cyberspace and deal with 
 
threats. The CSOC will work closely with the 
 
NCSC to confront the MoD’s cyber security 
 
challenges and contribute to wider national 
cyber security. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND39 

Measuring success 

 

5.3.11.  The Government will measure 
its success in protecting government 
networks, systems and data by assessing 
progress towards the following outcomes: 

•	 we are aware of, and actively 
 

mitigating, all known internet-facing 
vulnerabilities in government systems 
and services; and 

•	 all suppliers to the Government meet 
 
appropriate cyber security standards. 

•	 the Government has an in-depth 

 

understanding of the level of cyber 

security risk across the whole of 

government and the wider public 

sector;
 

•	 individual government departments 
 

and other bodies protect themselves 
in proportion to their level of risk and 
to an agreed government minimum 
standard; 

•	 government departments and the wider 
 

public sector are resilient and can 
respond effectively to cyber incidents, 
maintaining functions and recovering 
quickly; 

•	 new technologies and digital services 
 
deployed by government will be cyber 
secure by default; 

 

5.4.	  PROTECTING OUR CRITICAL 
 
 

 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
OTHER PRIORITY SECTORS 

 

 

Context 

 

5.4.1  The cyber security of certain UK 
organisations is of particular importance 
because a successful cyber attack on 
them would have the severest impact on 
the country’s national security. This impact 
could have a bearing on the lives of UK 
citizens, the stability and strength of the 
UK economy, or the UK’s international 
standing and reputation. This premium 
group of companies and organisations 
within the public and private sector 
includes the critical national infrastructure 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND40 

(CNI), which provides essential services 
to the nation. Ensuring the CNI is secure 
and resilient against cyber attack will be a 
priority for the Government. This premium 
group also includes other companies and 
organisations, beyond the CNI, that require 
a greater level of support. They include: 

•	 the jewels in our economic crown – 
 

the UK’s most successful companies 
and also those that hold our future 
economic strength in the value of their 
research and intellectual property; 

•	 data holders – not just organisations 
 
that hold large amounts of personal 
data, but also those that hold data on 
vulnerable citizens here and abroad, 
such as charities; 

•	 high-threat targets – such as media 
 

organisations, where an attack could 
harm the UK’s reputation, damage 
public confidence in the Government, 
or endanger freedom of expression; 

•	 the touchstones of our digital economy 
 

– digital service providers that enable 
e-commerce and our digital economy, 
and who depend on consumer trust in 
their services; and 

•	 those organisations that, through 
 

market forces and authority, can exert 
influence on the whole economy to 
improve their cyber security, such as 
insurers, investors, regulators and 
professional advisors. 

 

5.4.2.  More needs to be done to protect 
these vital parts of our economy and 
support the organisations that heavily 
influence others. Our CNI – in both the 
private and public sector – continues to 
 
be a target for attack. Across these and 
many other priority sectors cyber risk is 
 
still not properly understood or managed, 
even as the threat continues to diversify 
and increase. 

Objective 

 

5.4.3.  the UK Government, working 
 
with the Devolved Administrations and 
other responsible authorities where 
appropriate, will ensure that the UK’s 
 
most important organisations and 
companies, including the CNI, are 
sufficiently secure and resilient in the 
 
face of cyber attack. Neither the 
Government nor other public bodies will 
take on the responsibility to manage this 
risk for the private sector, which rightly 
 
sits with boards, owners and operators. 
 
But the Government will provide support 
 
and assurance proportionate both to the 
threat these companies and organisations 
face, and to the consequences of their 
being attacked. 

“Cyber security is key to unlocking 
innovation and expansion, and by 
adopting a tailored organisation 
and risk-centric approach to cyber 
security, organisations can refocus on 
opportunities and exploration. Building 
trust in a business that operates 
successfully within the Internet of 
Things (IoT), and that fully supports and 
protects individuals and their personal 
mobile devices (from a simple phone 
to a health care device, from smart 
appliances to smart cars), is a key 
competitive differentiator and must be 
a priority.” 

EY’s Global Information Security 
 
Survey 2015 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND41 

Our approach 

 

5.4.4.  Organisations and company 
boards are responsible for ensuring their 
networks are secure. They must identify 
critical systems and regularly assess 
their vulnerability against an evolving 
technological landscape and threat. 
They must invest in technology and their 
staff to reduce vulnerabilities in current 
and future systems, and in their supply 
chain, to maintain a level of cyber security 
proportionate to the risk. They must also 
have tested capabilities in place to respond 
if an attack happens. For the CNI, they 
must do this with government bodies and 
regulators so we can be confident that 
cyber risk is being properly managed and 
– if it is not – intervene in the interests of 
national security. 

 

5.4.5.  The Government will, therefore, 
understand the level of cyber security 
across our CNI and have measures in 
 
place to intervene where necessary 
 
to drive improvements that are in the 
national interest. 

5.4.6.  The Government will: 

 

•	 share threat information with industry 
 
that only the Government can obtain 
so they know what they must protect 
themselves against; 

•	 produce advice and guidance on how 
 

to manage cyber risk and, working 
collaboratively with industry and 
academia, define what good cyber 
security looks like; 

•	 stimulate the introduction of the high-
 

end security needed to protect the CNI, 
such as training facilities, testing labs, 
security standards and consultancy 
services; and 

•	 conduct exercises with CNI companies 
 
to assist them in managing their cyber 
risks and vulnerabilities. 

 

5.4.7.  The NCSC will provide these services 
 
for the UK’s most important companies 
 
and organisations, including the CNI. It will 
 
do so in partnership with departments and 
 
regulators, who will assure whether cyber 
 
risk is being managed in their sectors to the 
 
level demanded by the national interest. 

 

5.4.8.  The Government will also make 
sure that the right regulatory framework for 
cyber security is in place, one that: 

•	 ensures industry acts to protect itself 
 

from the threat; 

•	 is outcome focused and sufficiently 
 

flexible so that it will not fall behind the 
threat, or lead to compliance rather 
than sound risk management; 

•	 is agile enough to foster growth and 
 

innovation, rather than lead it; 

•	 is harmonised with regimes in other 
 
jurisdictions so that UK companies 
do not suffer from a fragmented and 
burdensome approach; and 

•	 delivers, when combined with 
 
 

effective support from the Government, 
 
a competitive advantage for the UK. 

 

5.4.9.  Many of our industry sectors 
 
are already regulated for cyber security. 
Nonetheless, we must ensure the right 
steps are taken across the whole 
 
economy, including the CNI, to manage 
cyber security risks. 

Measuring success 

 

5.4.10.  The Government will measure its 
success in protecting our CNI and other 
priority sectors by assessing progress 
towards the following outcomes: 

•	 we understand the level of cyber 
 
security across the CNI, and have 
measures in place to intervene, where 
necessary, to drive improvements in 
the national interest; and 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND42 

•	 our most important companies and 
 

organisations understand the level of 
threat and implement proportionate 
cyber security practices. 

 

5.5.	  CHANGING PUBLIC AND BUSINESS 
 
 

BEHAVIOURS 

 

5.5.1  A successful UK digital economy 
relies upon the confidence of businesses 
and the public in online services. The UK 
The Government has worked with industry 
and other parts of the public sector to 
increase awareness and understanding 
of the threat. The Government has also 
provided the public and business with 
access to some of the tools that they 
need to protect themselves. While there 
are many organisations that are doing an 
excellent job – in places, world-leading – of 
protecting themselves, and in providing 
services to others online, the majority of 
businesses and individuals are still not 
properly managing cyber risk. 

“Last year, the average cost of breaches 
 
to large businesses that had them was 
 
 
£36,500. For small firms the average 
cost of breaches was £3,100. 65% of 
 
large organisations reported they had 
 
suffered an information security breach 
 
in the past year, and 25% of these 
 
experienced a breach at least once a 
 
month. Nearly seven out of ten attacks 
 
involved viruses, spyware or malware 
 
that might have been prevented using the 
 
Government’s Cyber Essentials scheme.” 
2016 Government Cyber Health Check 
and Cyber Security Breaches Survey 

Objective 

 

5.5.2.  Our objective is to ensure that 
individuals and organisations, regardless of 
size or sector, are taking appropriate steps 
to protect themselves, and their customers, 
from the harm caused by cyber attacks. 

Our approach 

 

 

5.5.3.  The Government will provide the 
 
advice that the economy needs to protect 
 
itself. We will improve how this advice is 
 
delivered to maximise its effect. For the 
 
public, the Government will harness ‘trusted 
 
voices’ to increase the reach, credibility and 
 
relevance of our message. We will provide 
 
advice that is easy to act upon and relevant 
 
to individuals, at the point they are accessing 
 
services and exposing themselves to risk. 
 
We will involve the Devolved Administrations 
 
and other authorities as appropriate. 

 

5.5.4.  For businesses, we will work through 
 
organisations such as insurers, regulators 
 
and investors which can exert influence over 
 
companies to ensure they manage cyber 
 
risk. In doing so, we will highlight the clear 
 
business benefits and the pricing of cyber 
 
risk by market influencers. We will seek to 
 
understand better why many organisations 
 
still fail to protect themselves adequately and 
 
then work in partnership with organisations 
 
such as professional standards bodies, to 
 
move beyond raising awareness to persuade 
 
companies to take action. We will also make 
 
sure we have the right regulatory framework 
 
in place to manage those cyber risks the 
 
market fails to address. As part of this, we 
 
will seek to use levers, such as the GDPR, 
 
to drive up standards of cyber security and 
 
protect citizens. 

Individuals and organisations and 
 

5.5.5. 
 
organisations in the UK will have access to 
 
the information, education, and tools they 
 
need to protect themselves. To ensure we 
 
deliver a step-change in public behaviour, 
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND43 

we will maintain a coherent and consistent 
 
set of messages on cyber security guidance 
 
from both the Government and our partners. 
 
The NCSC will provide technical advice to 
 
underpin this guidance. It will reflect business 
 
and public priorities and practices, and 
 
be clear, easily accessible and consistent, 
 
while keeping pace with the threat. Law 
 
enforcement will work closely with industry 
 
and the NCSC to share the latest criminal 
 
threat intelligence, to support industry to 
 
defend itself against threats, and to mitigate 
 
the impact of attacks on UK victims. 

Measuring success 

 

5.5.6.  The Government will measure its 
success in protecting our CNI and other 

priority sectors by assessing progress 
towards the following outcomes: 

•	 the UK economy’s level of cyber 
 

security is as high as, or higher than, 
comparative advanced economies; 
•	 the number, severity and impact of 
 

successful cyber attacks against 
businesses in the UK has reduced, 
because cyber hygiene standards 
 
have improved; and 

•	 there is an improving cyber 
 
 

security culture across the UK 
 
because organisations and the 
 
public understand their cyber risk 
 
levels and understand the cyber 
hygiene steps they need to take to 
manage those risks. 

CYBER AWARE 

The Cyber Aware campaign, formerly 
Cyber Streetwise, gives the public the 
advice they need to protect themselves 
from cyber criminals. Targeted messaging 
delivered through social media and 
advertising and in partnership with 
businesses promotes: 

•	 using three random words to create a 
 

strong password; and 

•	 always downloading the latest 

 

software updates.
 
 

Experts agree adopting these 
 
behaviours will provide small businesses 
and individuals with protection 
 
against cyber crime. Cyber Aware 
 
is currently supported by 128 cross-
sector partners, including the police 
 
and businesses in the retail, leisure, 
 
travel and professional services sectors. 
In 2015/16 an estimated 10 million 
 
adults and 1 million small businesses 
stated they were more likely to maintain 

or take up key cyber security behaviours 
as a result of the Cyber Aware campaign.

CYBER ESSENTIALS 

The Cyber Essentials scheme was 
developed to show organisations how 
to protect themselves against low-level 
“commodity threat”. It lists five technical 
controls (access control; boundary 
firewalls and Internet gateways; malware 
protection; patch management and 
secure configuration) that organisations 
should have in place. The vast 
majority of cyber attacks use relatively 
simple methods which exploit basic 
vulnerabilities in software and computer 
systems. There are tools and techniques 
openly available on the Internet 
which enable even low-skill actors to 
exploit these vulnerabilities. Properly 
implementing the Cyber Essentials 
scheme will protect against the vast 
majority of common internet threats. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND44 

 

5.6.	  MANAGING INCIDENTS AND 
 

UNDERSTANDING THE THREAT 

 

5.6.1.  The number and severity of cyber 
incidents affecting organisations across 
the public and private sector are likely 
to increase. We therefore need to define 
how both the private sector and the public 
engage with the Government during a 
cyber incident. We will ensure that the 
UK Government’s level of support for 
each sector – taking into account its 
cyber maturity – is clearly defined and 
understood. The Government’s collection 
and dissemination of information about 
the threat must be delivered in a manner 
and at a speed suitable for all types 
of organisation. The private sector, 
government and the public can currently 
access multiple sources of information, 
guidance and assistance on cyber security. 
This must be simplified. 

 

5.6.2.  We must ensure that the 
Government offering, both in response 
to incidents, and in the provision of 
guidance, does not exist in isolation, but 
in partnership with the private sector. Our 
incident management processes should 
reflect a holistic approach to incidents, 
whereby we learn from partners and 
share mitigation techniques. We will also 
continue to use our relationships with other 
Computer Emergency Response Teams 
(CERTs) and our allies as an integrated part 
of our incident management function. 

 

5.6.3.  Current incident management 
remains somewhat fragmented across 
government departments and this strategy 
will create a unified approach. The NCSC 
will deliver a streamlined and effective 
government-led incident response function. 
In the event of a serious cyber incident, 
we will ensure that the Armed Forces are 
able to provide assistance, whether in a 
conventional form addressing the physical 
impact of an incident, or in the form of 

specialist support from regular or reserve 
cyber personnel. While we will provide 
all the support our resources will allow, 
the Government continues to stress the 
importance of industry, society and the 
public acting to safeguard their basic 
 
cyber security. 

Objectives 

5.6.4.	  Our objectives are as follows: 

 

•	 the Government will provide a single, 
 

joined-up approach to incident 
management, based on an improved 
understanding and awareness of the 
threat and actions being taken against 
us. The NCSC will be a key enabler, as 
will partnership with the private sector, 
law enforcement and other government 
departments, authorities and agencies; 

•	 the NCSC defines clear processes 
 

for reporting incidents, tailored to the 
profile of the victim; and 

•	 we will prevent the most common 

 
cyber incidents, and we will have 

effective information-sharing
 
 
structures in place to inform
 
 
‘pre-incident’ planning.
 
 

Our approach 

It is the responsibility of organisation 

5.6.5. 
 
and company management, in both the 
public and private sector, to ensure their 
networks are secure and to exercise 
incident response plans. In the event of 
a significant incident, the Government 
incident management process will reflect 
the three distinct elements of a cyber 
incident: the precursor causes, the incident 
itself and the post-incident response. 

 

5.6.6.  To deliver incident management 
that is effective for both government 
and the private sector, we will work 
closely to review and define the scope 
of the Government response to ensure it 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5 DEFEND45 

reinforces cooperation. We will build on 
our national cyber exercise plan, using our 
improved understanding and awareness of 
the threat, to improve our offer of support 
to public and private sector partners. 

 

5.6.7.  We will create a trusted and credible 
 
government identity for incident advice, 
 
assistance and assurance. This will increase 
 
the cyber security awareness across the 
 
UK digital community and will enable us 
 
the better to identify trends, take pro-active 
 
measures and, ultimately, prevent incidents. 

In moving towards automated 

5.6.8. 
 
information sharing (i.e. cyber security 
systems automatically alerting each other 
to incidents or attacks), we will deliver 
a more effective service. This will allow 
organisations to act swiftly on relevant 
threat information. 

Measuring success 

 

5.6.9.  The Government will measure 
its success in managing incidents by 
assessing progress towards the following 
outcomes: 

•	 a higher proportion of incidents are 
 

reported to the authorities, leading to 
a better understanding of the size and 
scale of the threat; 

•	 cyber incidents are managed 
 

more effectively, efficiently and 
comprehensively, as a result of the 
creation of the NCSC as a centralised 
incident reporting and response 
mechanism; and 

•	 we will address the root causes of 
 

attacks at a national level, reducing the 
occurrence of repeated exploitation 
across multiple victims and sectors. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 5DEFEND46
 

6. DETER 

 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 6 DETER47 

 

6.1.3.  We will pursue a comprehensive 
national approach to cyber security and 
deterrence that will make the UK a harder 
target, reducing the benefits and raising the 
costs to an adversary – be they political, 
diplomatic, economic or strategic. We must 
ensure our capability and intent to respond 
are understood by potential adversaries in 
order to influence their decision-making. 
We shall have the tools and capabilities 
we need: to deny our adversaries easy 
opportunities to compromise our networks 
and systems; to understand their intent and 
capabilities; to defeat commodity malware 
threats at scale; and to respond and 
protect the nation in cyberspace. 

6.2.  REDUCING CYBER CRIME 

 

 

6.2.1.  We need to raise the cost, raise 
the risk, and reduce the reward of cyber 
criminals’ activity. While we must harden 
the UK against cyber attacks and reduce 
vulnerabilities, we must also focus 
relentlessly on pursuing criminals who 
continue to target the UK. 

 

6.2.2.  Law enforcement agencies will 
focus their efforts on pursuing the criminals 
who persist in attacking UK citizens and 
businesses. We will work with domestic 
and international partners to target 
criminals wherever they are located, and to 
dismantle their infrastructure and facilitation 
networks. Law enforcement agencies will 
also continue to help raise awareness and 
standards of cyber security, in collaboration 
with the NCSC. 

 

6.0.1.  The National Security Strategy states 
that defence and protection start with 
deterrence. This is as true in cyberspace 
as any other sphere. To realise our vision 
of a nation that is secure and resilient 
to cyber threats, and prosperous and 
confident in the digital world, we have 
to dissuade and deter those who would 
harm us and our interests. To achieve 
this we all need to continue to raise levels 
of cyber security so that attacking us in 
cyberspace – whether to steal from us or 
harm us – is neither cheap nor easy. Our 
adversaries must know that they cannot act 
with impunity: that we can and will identify 
them, and that we can act against them, 
using the most appropriate response from 
amongst all the tools at our disposal. We 
will continue to build global alliances and 
promote the application of international law 
in cyberspace. We will also more actively 
disrupt the activity of all those who threaten 
us in cyberspace and the infrastructure on 
which they rely. Delivering this ambition 
requires world-class sovereign capabilities. 

6.1.  CYBER’S ROLE IN DETERRENCE 

 

 

6.1.1.  Cyberspace is only one sphere in 
which we must defend our interests and 
sovereignty. Just as our actions in the 
physical sphere are relevant to our cyber 
security and deterrence, so our actions and 
posture in cyberspace must contribute to 
our wider national security. 

 

6.1.2.  The principles of deterrence are as 
applicable in cyberspace as they are in the 
physical sphere. The UK makes clear that 
the full spectrum of our capabilities will be 
used to deter adversaries and to deny them 
opportunities to attack us. However, we 
recognise that cyber security and resilience 
are in themselves a means of deterring 
attacks that rely on the exploitation of 
vulnerabilities. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 6DETER48 

 

6.2.3.  This strategy complements the 
 
2013 Serious and Organised Crime 
Strategy, which set out the UK 
Government’s strategic response to 
 
cyber crime, alongside other types of 
serious and organised crime. The National 
Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) that sits within 
the National Crime Agency (NCA) was 
established to lead and coordinate the 
national response to cyber crime. Action 
Fraud provides a national reporting centre 
for fraud and cyber crime. A network 
of cyber crime units within Regional 
Organised Crime Units (ROCUs) provide 
access to specialist cyber capabilities at 
 
a regional level, supporting the NCCU 
 
and local forces. 

Objective 

 

6.2.4.  We will reduce the impact of cyber 
crime on the UK and its interests by 
deterring cyber criminals from targeting the 
UK and relentlessly pursuing those who 
persist in attacking us. 

Our approach 

 

6.2.5.  To reduce the impact of cyber crime, 
we will: 

 
•	 enhance the UK’s law enforcement 

capabilities and skills at national, 
regional and local level to identify, 
pursue, prosecute and deter cyber 
criminals within the UK and overseas; 

 
•	 build a better understanding of the 
cyber crime business model, so we 
know where to target interventions in 
order to have the most disruptive effect 
on criminal activity. We will use this 
knowledge to: 

- make the UK a high-cost, high-risk 
 
environment in which to operate by 
targeting the UK nexus of criminality, 
and by working with industry to 
reduce the ability of criminals to 

exploit UK infrastructure; and 

- tackle cyber crime upstream, adding 
 
 

friction to the criminal business model 
 
by dismantling their infrastructure 
 
and financial networks, and wherever 
 
possible, bringing offenders to justice. 

•	 build international partnerships to 
 

end the perceived impunity of cyber 
criminals acting against the UK, 
by bringing criminals in overseas 
jurisdictions to justice; 

•	 deter individuals from being attracted 
 

to, or becoming involved in, cyber 
crime by building on our early 
intervention measures; 

•	 enhance collaborations with industry to 
 
provide them with proactive intelligence 
on the threat, and to provide us with 
the upstream intelligence that they 
possess, in order to assist with our 
upstream disruption efforts; 

•	 develop a new 24/7 reporting and 
 
 

triage capability in Action Fraud, linked 
 
to the NCSC, the NCA’s National 
 
Cyber Crime Unit and the wider law 
 
enforcement community, to improve 
 
support to victims of cyber crime, to 
 
provide a faster response to reported 
 
crimes and enhanced protective 
 
security advice. A new reporting system 
 
will be established to share information 
 
in real time across law enforcement on 
 
cyber crime and threats; 

•	 work with the NCSC and the private 
 
sector to reduce vulnerabilities in UK 
infrastructure that could be exploited at 
scale by cyber criminals; and 

•	 work with the finance sector to make 
 

the UK a more hostile environment 
for those seeking to monetise stolen 
credentials, including by disrupting 
their networks. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 6 DETERMeasuring success 

 

 

6.2.6.  The Government will measure its 
 
success in reducing cyber crime by assessing 
 
progress towards the following outcomes: 

•	 we have a greater disruptive effect 
 

on cyber criminals attacking the UK, 
with higher numbers of arrests and 
convictions, and larger numbers of 
criminal networks dismantled as a 
result of law enforcement intervention; 

•	 there is improved law enforcement 
 

capability, including greater capacity 
and skills of dedicated specialists and 
mainstream officers and enhanced 
law enforcement capability amongst 
overseas partners; 

•	 there is improved effectiveness and 
 
increased scale of early intervention 
measures dissuades and reforms 
offenders; and 

•	 there are fewer low-level cyber 
 

offences as a result of cyber criminal 
services being harder to access and 
less effective. 

49 

 

6.3.	  COUNTERING HOSTILE FOREIGN 
 
 

ACTORS 

 

6.3.1.  We need to bring to bear the full 
range of government capabilities to counter 
the threat posed by hostile foreign actors 
that increasingly threaten our political, 
economic and military security. Working 
with international partners will be key to 
our success, and greater emphasis will 
be placed on engaging them and working 
with them to counter the threat. Much of 
this action will not be in the public domain. 
Our investment in sovereign capabilities 
and partnerships with industry and the 
private sector will continue to underpin our 
ability to detect, observe and identify this 
constantly evolving activity against us. 

Objective 

 

6.3.2.  We will have strategies, policies 
 
and priorities in place for each adversary, 
 
to ensure a proactive, well-calibrated and 
 
effective approach is taken to counter the 
 
threat and in order to drive down the number 
 
and severity of cyber incidents in the future. 
 

WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OF 

CYBER CRIME 


Our approach 

If you are a member of the public and 
you believe that you are the victim of 
cyber crime, or cyber enabled fraud, you 
should contact Action Fraud. 

You can report the incident using Action 
Fraud’s online fraud reporting tool 
anytime of the day or night, or call 0300 
123 2040. For further information see 
www.actionfraud.police.uk 

The Action Fraud service is run by the 

City of London Police.
 

 

6.3.3.  To reduce the cyber threat from 
hostile foreign actors, we will: 

•	 reinforce the application of 
 
 

international law in cyberspace in 
addition to promoting the agreement 
of voluntary, non-binding norms of 
responsible state behaviour and the 
development and implementation of 
confidence building measures; 

•	 work with international partners, 
 

particularly through collective defence, 
cooperative security, and enhanced 
deterrence that our membership of 
NATO affords; 

•	 identify both the unique and
 
 
 

generic aspects of our adversaries’ 

cyber activity;
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 6DETER50 

•	 generate and explore all available 
 

options for deterring and countering 
this threat, drawing on the full range of 
government capabilities. We will take 
full account of other related factors, 
including country-specific strategies, 
international cyber priorities, and cyber 
crime and prosperity objectives; 

•	 use existing networks and relationships 
 

with our key international partners 
to share information about current 
and nascent threats, adding value to 
existing thought and expertise; and 

•	 attribute specific cyber identities 

 
publicly when we judge it in the 

national interest to do so.
 

Measuring success 

 

6.3.4.  The Government will measure its 
success in countering the actions of hostile 
foreign actors by assessing progress 
towards the following outcomes: 

•	 the stronger information-sharing 
 

networks that we have established with 
our international partners, and wider 
multilateral agreements in support of 
lawful and responsible behaviour by 
states, are substantially contributing to 
our ability to understand and respond 
to the threat, resulting in a better 
defended UK; and 

•	 our defence and deterrence measures, 
 

alongside our country-specific 
strategies, are making the UK a 
 
harder target for hostile foreign 
 
actors to act against. 

terrorists using and intending to use cyber 
 
for this purpose. In doing so, we will 
 
minimise their impact and prevent an uplift 
 
in terrorist cyber capability that would further 
 
threaten UK networks and national security. 

Objective 

 

6.4.2.  To mitigate the threat of terrorist 
use of cyber, through the identification 
and disruption of terrorist cyber actors 
who currently hold, and aspire to build, 
capability that could threaten UK 
 
national security. 

Our approach 

 

6.4.3.  To ensure the threat posed by cyber 
terrorism remains low, we will: 

•	 detect cyber terrorism threats, 
 

identifying actors who are seeking to 
conduct damaging network operations 
against the UK and our allies; 

•	 investigate and disrupt these cyber 
 

terrorism actors to prevent them from 
using cyber capability against the UK 
and its allies; and 

•	 work closely with international partners 
 
to enable us to better tackle the threat 
from cyber terrorism. 

Measuring success 

 

6.4.4.  The Government will measure 
its success in preventing terrorism by 
assessing progress towards the 
 
following outcomes: 

6.4.  PREVENTING TERRORISM 

 

 

6.4.1.  The technical capability of terrorists 
 
currently remains limited but they continue 
 
to aspire to conduct damaging computer 
 
 
network operations against the UK, with 
publicity and disruption as the primary 
 
objective of their cyber activity. The 
 
 
Government will identify and disrupt 

•	 a full understanding of risk posed by 
 
cyber terrorism, through identification 
and investigation of cyber terrorism 
threats to the UK; and 

•	 close monitoring, and disruption of 
 

terrorist cyber capability at the earliest 
opportunity, with the aim of preventing 
an increase in such terrorist capability 
in the long term. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 6 DETER 

6.5.	  ENHANCING SOVEREIGN 
 

CAPABILITIES – OFFENSIVE CYBER 

 

 

6.5.1.  Offensive cyber capabilities involve 
deliberate intrusions into opponents’ 
systems or networks, with the intention 
of causing damage, disruption or 
destruction. Offensive cyber forms part 
of the full spectrum of capabilities we 
will develop to deter adversaries and to 
deny them opportunities to attack us, in 
both cyberspace and the physical sphere. 
Through our National Offensive Cyber 
Programme (NOCP), we have a dedicated 
capability to act in cyberspace and we 
will commit the resources to develop and 
improve this capability. 

Objective 

 

6.5.2.  We will ensure that we have at 
our disposal appropriate offensive cyber 
capabilities that can be deployed at a 
time and place of our choosing, for both 
deterrence and operational purposes, in 
accordance with national and international 
law. 

Our approach 

6.5.3.	  To do this, we will: 

 

 
•	 invest in our NOCP – the partnership 
between the Ministry of Defence and 
GCHQ that is harnessing the skills and 
talents of both organisations to deliver 
the tools, techniques and tradecraft 
required; 

 
•	 develop our ability to use offensive 


cyber tools; and
 

51 

Measuring success 

 

6.5.4.  The Government will measure our 
success in establishing offensive cyber 
capabilities by assessing progress towards 
the following outcomes: 

•	 the UK is a world leader in offensive 
 

cyber capability; and 

•	 the UK has established a pipeline
 
 
 
of skills and expertise to develop
 
 
and deploy our sovereign offensive 

cyber capabilities.
 

 
6.6.	  ENHANCING SOVEREIGN 
 

CAPABILITIES – CRYPTOGRAPHY 

 

 

 

6.6.1.  Cryptographic capability is 
fundamental to protecting our most 
sensitive information and to choosing how 
we deploy our Armed Forces and national 
security capabilities. To maintain this 
capability, we will require private sector 
skills and technologies that are assured by 
GCHQ. This is likely to require work to be 
done in the UK, by British Nationals with 
the requisite security clearance, working 
for companies who are prepared to be 
completely open with GCHQ in discussing 
design and implementation details. The 
MOD and GCHQ are working to establish 
a sound understanding of the long-term 
cost implications of maintaining such 
sovereign cryptographic capabilities, based 
on prevailing market conditions and in 
cooperation with those companies currently 
able to provide such solutions. 

Objective 

 
•	 develop the ability of our Armed Forces 

to deploy offensive cyber capabilities 
as an integrated part of operations, 
thereby enhancing the overall impact 
we can achieve through military action. 

 

6.6.2.  We have the confidence that the 
UK will always have political control over 
those cryptographic capabilities vital to our 
national security and, therefore, the means 
to protect UK secrets. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 6DETER52 

Our approach 

ENCRYPTION 

 

6.6.3.  We will select the means that allow 
us to share information effectively with our 
allies, and ensure that trusted information 
and information systems are available, 
when and where required. Working closely 
with other government departments and 
agencies, GCHQ and MOD will together 
define sovereign requirements, and how 
best to meet those requirements when 
suppliers must be domestic. This will be 
delivered through a new joint framework for 
determining requirements for operational 
advantage and freedom of action. 

Measuring success 

 

6.6.4.  The Government will measure its 
success in maintaining our cryptographic 
capabilities by assessing progress towards 
the following outcome: 

•	 our sovereign cryptographic 
 

capabilities are effective in keeping our 
secrets and sensitive information safe 
from unauthorised disclosure. 

Encryption is the process of encoding 
data or information to prevent 
unauthorised access to it. 

The Government is in favour of 
encryption. It is a foundation stone 
of a strong, internet-based economy: 
it keeps people’s personal data and 
intellectual property secure, and ensures 
safe online commerce. 

But as technology continues to evolve, 
we have to ensure that there are no 
guaranteed ‘safe spaces’ for terrorists 
and criminals to operate beyond the 
reach of the law. 

The Government wants to work with 
industry as technology develops 
to ensure that, with a robust legal 
framework and clear oversight, the 
police and intelligence agencies 
can access the content of the 
communications of terrorists and 
criminals. Existing legislation allows 
for the communications of criminals 
and terrorists to be intercepted when 
a warrant is in place. Companies 
have a duty to give effect to such 
a warrant, providing the requested 
communications, to the relevant 
authority. When served with a warrant, 
companies are asked to remove any 
encryption that they themselves have 
applied, or that has been applied 
on their behalf, so that the material 
provided is in readable form. The law 
stipulates that companies are required 
to take reasonable steps to give effect 
to a warrant, and any assessment 
of reasonableness will include an 
assessment of the steps a company is 
required to take to remove encryption.

7. DEVELOP 

 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7 DEVELOP 

7.0.1.  The DEVELOP strand of the strategy 
sets out how we will acquire and strengthen 
the tools and capabilities that the UK needs 
to protect itself from the cyber threat. 

 

7.0.2.  The UK requires more talented 
 
and qualified cyber security professionals. 
The Government will act now to plug 
the growing gap between demand and 
supply for key cyber security roles, and 
inject renewed vigour into this area of 
education and training. This is a long-term, 
transformative objective, and this strategy 
will kick-start this important work, which 
 
will necessarily continue beyond 2021. 
A skilled workforce is the lifeblood of a 
vital and world leading cyber security 
commercial ecosystem. This ecosystem 
 
will ensure cyber start-ups prosper and 
receive the investment and support they 
need. This innovation and vigour can only 
be provided by the private sector; but 
the Government will act to support its 
development, and actively promote the 
wider cyber security sector to the world 
market. A dynamic and thriving scientific 
research sector is required to support both 
the development of highly skilled people, 
and to ensure that new ideas translate into 
cutting-edge products. 

 

7.1.	  STRENGTHENING CYBER SECURITY 
 
 

SKILLS 

 

7.1.1.  The UK needs to tackle the systemic 
issues at the heart of the cyber skills 
shortage: the lack of young people entering 
the profession; the shortage of current 
cyber security specialists; insufficient 
exposure to cyber and information security 
concepts in computing courses; a shortage 
of suitably qualified teachers; and the 
absence of established career and training 
pathways into the profession. 

 

7.1.2.  This calls for swift intervention by 
 
 
the Government to help address the 
current shortage and develop a coherent 

55 

 
long-term strategy that can build on 
 
these interventions to close the skills 
 
gap. However, it must be recognised 
 
that to have any profound impact, this 
effort must be collaborative, with input 
from a range of participants and influencers 
across the Devolved Administrations, 
 
public sector, education providers, 
academia bodies and industry. 

Objective 

 

7.1.3.  The Government’s ambition is to 
ensure the sustained supply of the best 
possible home-grown cyber security talent, 
whilst funding specific interventions in the 
short term to help meet known skills gaps. 
We will also define and develop the cyber 
security skills needed across the population 
and workforce to operate safely and 
securely online. 

 

7.1.4.  This requires action over the next 
twenty years, not just the next five. We will 
define the long-term, coordinated set of 
actions needed by government, industry, 
education providers and academia to 
establish a sustained supply of competent 
cyber security professionals, who meet 
the requisite standards and certification to 
practise confidently and securely. 

 

7.1.5.  We will close the skills gap in 
Defence. We will attract cyber specialists 
to government who are not only effectively 
trained but also ready to maintain our 
national security. This includes an 
understanding of the impact of cyberspace 
on military operations. 

Our approach 

 

7.1.6.  We will develop and implement a 
self-standing skills strategy that builds on 
existing work to integrate cyber security 
into the education system. This will 
continue to improve the state of computer 
science teaching overall and embed cyber 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7DEVELOP56 

security into the curriculum. Everyone 
studying computer science, technology 
or digital skills will learn the fundamentals 
of cyber security and will be able to bring 
those skills into the workforce. As part 
of this effort, we will address the gender 
imbalance in cyber-focused professions, 
and reach people from more diverse 
backgrounds, to make sure we are 
 
drawing from the widest available talent 
pool. We will work closely with the 
Devolved Administrations to encourage a 
consistent approach across the UK. 

 

7.1.7.  We will set out more clearly the 
respective roles of government and 
industry, including how these might 
evolve over time. The UK Government 
and Devolved Administrations have a 
key role in creating the right environment 
for cyber security skills to be developed 
and to update the education system to 
reflect the changing needs of industry and 
government. But employers also have a 
significant responsibility to clearly articulate 
their needs, as well as train and develop 
employees and young people entering 
 
the profession. Industry has an important 
role in building diverse and attractive 
 
career and training pathways in partnership 
with academia, professional bodies and 
trade associations. 

7.1.8. 
 
In recognition of the collective 
challenge we face in closing the skills 
gap, we will establish a skills advisory 
group formed of government, employers, 
professional bodies, skills bodies, 
education providers and academia, which 
will strengthen the coherence between 
these key sectors. This group will support 
the development of a long-term strategy 
which will take account of developments in 
the broad field of digital skills, ensuring that 
cyber security considerations are aligned 
and incorporated throughout. This group 
will work with similar bodies across the UK. 

 

7.1.9.  Alongside this work, the Government 
will invest in a range of initiatives to bring 
about immediate improvements and inform 
the development of the long-term skills 
strategy. These include: 

•	 establishing a schools programme 
 
 

to create a step change in specialist 
cyber security education and 
 
training for talented 14-18 year olds 
(involving classroom-based activities, 
after-school sessions with expert 
mentors, challenging projects and 
summer schools); 

•	 creating higher and degree-level 
 

apprenticeships within the energy, 
finance and transport sectors to 
address skills gaps in essential areas; 

•	 establishing a fund to retrain 
 

candidates already in the workforce 
who show a high potential for the cyber 
security profession; 

•	 identifying and supporting quality cyber 
 
graduate and post graduate education, 
and identifying and filling any specialist 
skills gaps – acknowledging the key 
role that universities play in skills 
development; 

•	 supporting the accreditation of teacher 
 

professional development in cyber 
security. This work will help teachers, 
and others supporting learning, to 
understand cyber security education 
and provide a method of externally 
accrediting such individuals; 
•	 developing the cyber security 
 
 

profession, including through achieving 
 
Royal Chartered status by 2020, 
 
reinforcing the recognised body of cyber 
 
security excellence within the industry 
 
and providing a focal point which can 
 
advise, shape and inform national policy; 
•	 developing a Defence Cyber Academy 
 

as a centre of excellence for cyber 
training and exercise across the 
Ministry of Defence and wider 
Government, addressing specialist 
skills and wider education; 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7 DEVELOP 
•	 developing opportunities for 

collaboration in training and education 
between government, the Armed 
Forces, industry and academia, 
together with facilities to maintain and 
exercise skills; and 

•	 we will work with industry to expand the 
 
 

CyberFirst programme to identify and 
 
nurture the diverse young talent pool to 
 
defend our national security; and 

•	 embedding cyber security and digital 
 
skills as an integral an integral part of 
relevant courses within the education 
system, from primary to postgraduate 
levels, setting standards, improving 
quality and providing a firm foundation 
for onwards progression into the field. 

As education is a devolved matter, 
 
some of these initiatives will apply mainly 
in England. We will however work with the 
Devolved Administrations to encourage 
a consistent approach across the UK 
education systems. 

Measuring success 

 

7.1.10.  The Government will measure our 
success in strengthening cyber security 
skills by assessing progress towards the 
following outcomes: 

 
•	 there are effective and clear entry 

routes into the cyber-security 
profession, which are attractive to a 
diverse range of people; 

 
•	 by 2021 cyber security is taught 

effectively as an integral part of 

 
relevant courses from primary to
 
post-graduate level;
 

 
•	 cyber security is widely acknowledged 
as an established profession with clear 
career pathways, and has achieved 
Royal Chartered Status; 

 
•	 appropriate cyber security knowledge 

is an integral part of the continual 
professional development for relevant 
non-cyber security professionals, 

57 

across the economy; and 

•	 the Government and the Armed Forces 
 
and the Armed Forces have access to 
cyber specialists able to maintain the 
security and resilience of the UK. 

 

7.2.	  STIMULATING GROWTH IN THE 
 

CYBER SECURITY SECTOR 

 

 

7.2.1.  A burgeoning and innovative cyber 
 
security sector is a necessity for our modern, 
 
digital economy. UK cyber security firms 
 
provide world-leading technologies, training 
 
and advice to industry and governments. 
 
But whilst the UK is a leading player, it faces 
 
fierce competition to stay ahead. There are 
 
also barriers that the Government needs 
 
to address. UK companies and academics 
 
develop cutting-edge technology, but some 
 
 
require support to develop the commercial 
and entrepreneurial skills required to thrive. 
 
There are funding gaps that prevent SMEs 
 
from growing and expanding into new 
 
markets and territories. The most ground­
breaking products and services, 
 
that offer the potential to keep us ahead 
 
of the threat, struggle to find customers 
 
who are willing to act as early adopters. 
 
Overcoming these challenges requires 
 
government, industry and academia to 
 
work effectively together. 

Objective 

 

7.2.2.  The Government will support the 
creation of a growing, innovative and 
thriving cyber security sector in the UK in 
order to create an ecosystem where: 

 
•	 security companies prosper, and get 

the investment they need to grow; 
 
•	 the best minds from government, 
academia and the private sector 
collaborate closely to spur innovation; and 

 
•	 customers of the Government and 
industry are sufficiently confident 
and prepared to adopt cutting-edge 
services. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7DEVELOP58 

Our approach 

7.2.3.  To create this ecosystem, we will: 

 

•	 commercialise innovation in academia, 
 

providing training and mentoring to 
academics; 

•	 establish two innovation centres, to 
 

drive the development of cutting-edge 
cyber products and dynamic new cyber 
security companies, which will sit at 
the heart of a programme of initiatives 
to give start-ups the support they need 
to get their first customers and attract 
further investment; 

•	 allocate a proportion of the £165m 
 

Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund 
to support innovative procurement in 
defence and security; 

•	 provide testing facilities for companies 
 
to develop their products, together with 
a fast-track form of assessment for 
the next generation of cyber security 
products and services as they emerge, 
enabling customers to be confident in 
their use; 

•	 draw on the collective expertise of
 
 
 

the industry-government Cyber
 
 
Growth Partnership to help shape
 
 
and focus further growth and 

innovation interventions;
 

•	 help companies of all sizes scale-up 
 

and access international markets; and 

•	 promote agreed international standards 
 

that support access to the UK market. 

 

7.2.4.  We will also use the weight 
of government procurement to spur 
innovation. The Government faces some of 
 
the hardest challenges in cyber security, 
and some of the biggest threats. We 
can, and must, pursue the most effective 
solutions to these problems. That means 
making it easier for smaller companies 
to do business with government. It also 
means the Government must be less risk 
averse in testing and using new products. 
This is a win-win solution: the Government 
will get the best services, and innovative 
technology will get an early adopter, 
making it easier to attract investment 
 
and a larger customer base. We will 
encourage all parts of government, 
including the Devolved Administrations, 
 
to take a similar approach. 

“We want to create a cyber ecosystem 
in which cyber start-ups proliferate, get 
the investment and support they need 
to win business around the world, to 
provide a pipeline of innovation that 
channels ideas between the private 
sector, government and academia.” 

The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, 
 
Minister of State for Digital and Culture 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7 DEVELOPMeasuring success 

 The Government will measure its 

 
7.2.5.
success in stimulating growth in the cyber 
security sector by assessing progress 
towards the following outcomes: 

 
•	 greater than average global growth 
 

in the size of the UK cyber sector year 
on year; 

 
•	 a significant increase in investment in 

early stage companies; 

 
•	 adoption of more innovative and 

effective cyber security technologies in 
government. 

 

7.3.	  PROMOTING CYBER SECURITY 
 
 

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 

 

7.3.1.  The UK’s thriving science and 
technology sector and its cutting-edge 
research, underpins our world-leading 
cyber security capabilities. To maintain 
and enhance the UK’s reputation as a 
global leader in cutting-edge research, 
we need our academic research 
establishments to continue to attract the 
best and the brightest minds in the field 
of cyber security. This will require us to 
foster centres of excellence that attract 
the most able and dynamic scientists 
and researchers, and deepen the active 
partnership between academia, the 
Government and industry. This will involve 
a match-making role for the Government, 
where we incentivise such collaborations. 
Success would see us establish a self-
sustaining ecosystem that allows ideas – 
and people – to circulate between the 
 
three sectors in a mutually beneficial way. 

Objective 

 

7.3.2.  By 2021, the UK will have 
strengthened its position as a world 
leader in cyber science and technology. 
Flexible partnerships between universities 
and industry will translate research into 

59 

commercially successful products and 
services. The UK will maintain its reputation 
for innovative excellence, including in those 
areas of exceptional national strength, such 
as the financial sector. 

Our approach 

 

7.3.3.  To achieve this, the Government will 
 
encourage collaboration, innovative and 
 
flexible funding models for research, and the 
 
commercialisation of research. Government 
 
will ensure that the human and behavioural 
 
aspects of cyber are given sufficient 
 
attention, and that systems beyond the 
 
technical, such as business processes 
 
and organisational structures, are included 
 
within cyber science and technology. 

 

7.3.4.  This will underpin the creation 
of products, systems and services that 
are ‘secure by default’, with appropriate 
security considered from the outset and 
where security becomes a conscious 
 
‘opt-out’ for users. 

 

7.3.5.  We will publish a detailed Cyber 
Science and Technology Strategy after a 
thorough consultation with partners and 
stakeholders. This will include identifying 
areas of science and technology that 
the Government, industry and academia 
consider to be important and identifying 
gaps in the UK’s current capacity to 
address them. 

 

7.3.6.  The Government will continue 
 
to provide funding and support for the 
 
Academic Centres of Excellence, Research 
 
Institutes and Centres for Doctoral Training. 
 
In addition, we will create a new Research 
 
Institute in a strategically important subject 
 
area. We will also fund further research in 
 
those areas where the upcoming Cyber 
 
Science and Technology Strategy identifies 
 
capability gaps. Important areas that will 
 
be given consideration include: big data 
 
analytics; autonomous systems; trustworthy 
 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7DEVELOP60 

industrial control systems; cyber-physical 
 
systems and the Internet of Things; smart 
 
cities; automated system verification; and 
 
the science of cyber security. 

•	 the UK is regarded as a global leader in 
 
 
cyber security research and innovation. 
 

7.4.  EFFECTIVE HORIZON SCANNING 

 

 

7.3.7.  We will continue to sponsor UK 
national PhD students at the Academic 
Centres of Excellence to increase the 
number of UK nationals with cyber 
expertise. 

 

7.3.8.  The Government will work with 
bodies, including Innovate UK and 
the Research Councils to encourage 
collaboration between industry, the 
Government and academia. To support this 
collaboration we will review best practice 
concerning security classifications and 
identify security-cleared experts, including 
academics. This will ensure that work from 
the unclassified space to beyond secret 
can be as collaborative as possible. 

 

7.3.9.  The Government will fund a ‘grand 
challenge’ to identify and provide innovative 
solutions to some of the most pressing 
problems in cyber security. CyberInvest, a 
new industry and Government partnership 
to support cutting-edge cyber security 
research and protect the UK in cyberspace, 
will be part of our approach to building 
the academic-government-industry 
partnership. 

Measuring success 

 

7.3.10.  The Government will measure 
its success in promoting cyber security 
science and technology by assessing 
progress towards the following outcomes: 
 

•	 significantly increased numbers 

 

of UK companies successfully 

commercialising academic cyber 

research and fewer agreed and 

identified gaps in the UK’s cyber 

security research capability with 

effective action to close them; and
 

 

7.4.1.  The Government must ensure 
 
that policy-making takes account of the 
 
changing cyber, geopolitical and technology 
 
landscape. To do this, we need to make 
 
 
effective use of broad horizon scanning 
and assessment work. We need to invest in 
 
proofing ourselves against future threats and 
 
anticipate market changes that might affect 
 
 
our cyber resilience in five to ten years’ time. 
We need horizon scanning programmes 
 
that generate recommendations to inform 
 
 
current and future government policy and 
programme planning. 

Objective 

 

7.4.2.  The Government will ensure that our 
 
horizon scanning programmes include a 
 
rigorous assessment of cyber risk, and that 
 
this is integrated into cyber security and 
 
other technology policy development areas, 
 
along with all-source assessment and other 
 
available evidence. We will join up horizon 
 
scanning between national security and other 
 
policy areas to ensure a holistic assessment 
 
of emerging challenges and opportunities. 
 

Our approach 

7.4.3.  We will: 

 

•	 identify gaps in current work, and 
 
 

coordinate work across disciplinary 
 
boundaries to develop a holistic approach 
 
to horizon scanning for cyber security; 
 

•	 promote better integration of technical 
 

aspects of cyber security with 
behavioural science; 

•	 support rigorous monitoring of the 
 
cyber criminal market place to spot 
 
new tools and services that might 
enable technology transfer to hostile 
states, terrorists or criminals; 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 7 DEVELOP61 

•	 analyse emergent internet-connected 
 

process control technologies; 

•	 anticipate vulnerabilities around digital 
 

currencies; and 

•	 monitor market trends in 

 

telecommunications technologies 

to develop early defences against 

anticipated future attacks. 


 

7.4.4.  We recognise that horizon scanning 
goes beyond the technical, to include 
political, economic, legislative, social 
and environmental dimensions. Cyber 
security is just one aspect of the issues 
that effective horizon scanning can help 
to address. Therefore, we will ensure that 
where we conduct horizon scanning of 
these other policy areas, we will take into 
account any cyber security implications. 

 

7.4.5.  We will also ensure that cyber 
policy-making follows an evidence-based 
approach, taking into account assessments 
from all available sources. This will include, 
for example: 

•	 international strategic and societal 

 
trends and their impact on cyber.
 

 

7.4.6.  We will ensure that cyber security is 
considered within the remit of the cross-
Government Emerging Technology and 
Innovation Analysis Cell (ETIAC), which 
will be established to identify technology 
threats and opportunities relevant to 
national security and that cyber is 
considered by existing horizon-scanning 
structures, including the Government 
Futures Group (GFG), and the Cabinet 
Secretary’s Advisory Group on horizon 
scanning (CSAG). 

Measuring success 

 

7.4.7.  The Government will measure our 
success in establishing an effective horizon 
scanning capability by assessing progress 
towards the following outcomes: 

•	 cross-government horizon scanning 
 
 

and all-source assessment are 
 
integrated into cyber policy making; and 

•	 specific technical evidence, for example 
 
 

•	 the impact of cyber security is
 
 
 

on the Internet of Things, or the future 
 
role of advanced materials; and 

factored into all cross-government 

horizon scanning.

8. INTERNATIONAL 

 
ACTION 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 8 INTERNATIONAL ACTION 

8.1.  Our economic prosperity and 
social wellbeing increasingly depend on 
the openness and security of networks 
that extend beyond our own borders. 
It is essential that we work closely with 
international partners to ensure the 
continuation of a free, open, peaceful and 
secure cyberspace that delivers these 
benefits. This will only become more 
important as the next billion users come 
online across the globe. 

International cooperation on 
 

8.2. 
 
cyber issues has become an essential 
 
part of wider global economic and 
 
security debates. It is a rapidly evolving 
area of policy, without a single agreed 
international vision. The UK and its allies 
have been successful in ensuring some 
elements of the rules-based international 
system are in place: there has been 
agreement that international law applies 
 
in cyberspace; that human rights apply 
online as they do offline; and a broad 
consensus that the multi-stakeholder 
approach is the best way to manage the 
complexities of governing the Internet. 
However, with a growing divide over how 
to address the common challenge of 
reconciling national security with individual 
rights and freedoms, any global consensus 
remains fragile. 

“We must work internationally to agree 
the rules of the road that will ensure 
the UK’s future security and prosperity 
in cyberspace.” 

The Rt. Hon. Boris Johnson, MP, 
 
Foreign Secretary 

63 

Objectives 

The UK aims to safeguard the 
 

 
8.3. 
long-term future of a free, open, peaceful 
and secure cyberspace, driving economic 
growth and underpinning the UK’s national 
security. On this basis, the UK will continue 
to: champion the multi-stakeholder 
model of internet governance; oppose 
data localisation; and work to build the 
capacity of our partners to improve their 
own cyber security. In order to reduce the 
threat to the UK and our interests, much 
of which originates overseas, we will seek 
to influence the decision-making of those 
engaging in cyber crime, cyber espionage, 
and disruptive or destructive cyber activity 
and continue to build frameworks to 
support international cooperation. 

Our Approach 

8.4. 
 

To do this we will: 

•	 strengthen and embed a common 

 
understanding of responsible state 

behaviour in cyberspace;
 

•	 build on agreement that international 
 

law applies in cyberspace; 

•	 continue to promote the agreement

Measuring Success 

8.6 
 
The Government will measure its 
success in advancing our international 
interests in cyber by assessing progress 
towards the following outcomes: 

•	 enhanced international collaboration 
 
reduces cyber threat to the UK and 
 
our interest overseas; 

•	 a common understanding of 

 

responsible state behaviour in 

cyberspace;
 

•	 international partners have increased 
 

their cyber security capability; and 

•	 strengthened international consensus 
 

on the benefits of a free, open, 
peaceful and secure cyberspace. 

64 

internationally (including encryption), 
making cyberspace more ‘secure by 
design’ and promoting best practice; 

•	 work to build common approaches 
 
amongst like-minded countries for 
capabilities such as strong encryption, 
which have cross-border implications; 

•	 build the capacity of others to tackle 
 
threats to the UK, and our interests 
overseas; 

•	 continue to help our partners develop 
 

their own cyber security – since 
we share a single cyberspace, we 
collectively become stronger when 
each country improves its own 
defences; 

•	 ensure that NATO is prepared for the 
 

conflicts of the 21st century, which will 
play out in cyberspace as well as on 
the battlefield; 

•	 work with our allies to enable NATO to 
 
operate as effectively in cyberspace as 
it does on land, air and sea; and 

•	 ensure that the ‘London Process’ of 
 
Global Conferences on Cyberspace 
continues to promote global consensus 
towards a free, open, peaceful and 
secure cyberspace. 

8.5. 
 
There are a range of relationships 
and tools we will continue to invest in to 
deliver and underpin all our international 
cyber objectives; we cannot achieve our 
objectives in isolation. These include: 

•	 working in concert with traditional 
 

allies and new partners to establish 
and maintain strong active political 
and operational relationships; creating 
the political conditions to build strong 
global alliances; 

•	 using our influence with multilateral 
 

organisations such as the United 
Nations, G20, European Union, 
NATO, OSCE, Council of Europe, the 
Commonwealth and within the global 
development community; and

9. METRICS 

 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 9 METRICS 

9.1.  Cyber security remains an area of 
relative immaturity when it comes to the 
measurement of outcomes and impacts 
– normally referred to as metrics. Already 
the science of cyber security has been 
obscured by hyperbole and obstructed 
by an absence of calibrated data. This is 
a source of frustration for policy-makers 
and businesses alike, who have struggled 
to measure investment against outcomes. 
The Government assesses that the effective 
use of metrics is essential for delivering this 
strategy and focussing the resources that 
underpin it. 

 

9.2.  We will ensure that this strategy 
is founded upon a rigorous and 
comprehensive set of metrics against 
which we measure progress towards the 
outcomes we need to achieve. As well 
as being a major deliverable under the 
Strategy in its own right, the NCSC will 
play a crucial role in enabling other parts of 
Government, industry and society to deliver 
all of these strategic outcomes within this 
strategy. 

Annex 3 sets out how the success 

9.3. 
 
measures set out in the strategy will 
contribute to the strategic outcomes, 
which will be reviewed annually to ensure 
they accurately reflect our national goals 
and requirements. The headline, strategic 
outcomes are as follows: 

67 

 

1.	  The UK has the capability effectively 
to detect investigate and counter the 
threat from the cyber activities of our 
adversaries. 

2.	  The impact of cybercrime on the 

 

UK and its interests is significantly 
reduced and cyber criminals are 
deterred from targeting the UK. 

3.	  The UK has the capability to manage 

 

and respond effectively to cyber 
incidents to reduce the harm they 
cause to the UK and counter cyber 
adversaries. 

4.	  Our partnerships with industry on 

 

active cyber defence mean that large 
scale phishing and malware attacks 
are no longer effective. 

5.	  The UK is more secure as a result of 

 

technology products and services 
having cyber security designed into 
them and activated by default. 

6.	  Government networks and services 

 

will be as secure as possible from the 
moment of their first implementation. 
The public will be able to use 
government digital services with 
confidence and trust that their 
information is safe. 

7.	  All organisations in the UK, large 

 

and small, are effectively managing 
their cyber risk and are supported by 
high quality advice designed by the 
NCSC, underpinned by the right mix 
of regulation and incentives. 

 

8.	  There is the right ecosystem in the 
UK to develop and sustain a cyber 
security sector that can meet our 
national security demands. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 9METRICS68 

9.	  The UK has a sustainable supply 

 

11. The UK government is already 

 

of home grown cyber skilled 
professionals to meet the growing 
demands of an increasingly digital 
economy, in both the public and 
private sectors, and defence. 

10. The UK is universally acknowledged 
 

 

as a global leader in cyber security 
 
research and development, 
 
underpinned by high levels of expertise 
 
in UK industry and academia. 

planning and preparing for policy 
implementation in advance of future 
technologies and threats and is 
 
‘future proofed’. 

 

12. The threat to the UK and our interests 
overseas is reduced due to increased 
international consensus and capability 
towards responsible state behaviour 
in a free, open peaceful and secure 
cyberspace. 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016Section 9 METRICS69 

longer term outcomes are allocated beyond 
2021 to industry, regulators, auditors, 
insurers and other parts of the public and 
private sector, as the effective management 
of cyber security risks is integrated into 
standard management activity for all. 

13. UK Government policies, 

 

organisations and structures are 
simplified to maximise the coherence 
and effectiveness of the UK’s 
response to the cyber threat. 

 

9.4.  We recognise that some of our 
ambitions for this strategy go beyond 
its five year timescale. In order that any 
future investment in cyber beyond 2021 
can continue to deliver the maximum 
transformative effect, we intend that these

CONCLUSION: 
CYBER SECURITY 
BEYOND 2021 

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016CONCLUSION CYBER SECURITY BEYOND 202171 

 

10.1.  The rapid evolution of the cyber 
landscape will constantly throw up new 
challenges as technology evolves and our 
adversaries act to exploit it. However, this 
strategy aims to provide a range of policies, 
tools and capabilities that will ensure we 
can respond quickly and flexibly to each 
new challenge as it arises. 

 

10.4.  Even in the most optimistic scenario, 
some of the challenges the UK faces in 
the cyber domain, whether in scale or 
complexity, may need more than five years 
to address. This strategy nonetheless 
provides us with the means to transform 
our future security and safeguard our 
prosperity in the digital era. 

 

10.2.  Should we fail to act effectively, 
 
the threat will continue to outpace our 
ability to protect ourselves against it. 
 
We can expect an explosion of threat 
capability at all levels. 

 

10.3.  Conversely, if we realise these 
ambitions, all parts of UK government, 
business and society will play their part 
in delivering the country’s overall cyber 
security. If we can ensure security is 
designed and built in, by default, into 
commodity technologies, consumers 
 
and businesses would have less cause 
 
to worry about cyber security. Should 
 
the UK consolidate its reputation as a 
secure environment to do business online, 
more global companies and investors 
 
will choose to locate here. Security for 
 
CNI networks and priority sectors would 
 
be more effective. Potential attackers 
looking to develop tools and attack 
methods against systems holding key 
functions and data would in turn have 
to work harder to overcome the layered 
security that surrounds them. This would 
change the risk versus reward equation 
for cyber criminals and malicious actors, 
who would expect to face the same threat 
of prosecution internationally as they do 
for traditional crimes. If we can succeed 
in mainstreaming cyber security across 
all parts of our society, it could mean that 
Government itself can step back from 
 
such a prominent role, allowing the 
 
market and the technology to drive the 
evolution of cyber security across the 
economy and society.

have established with our international partners, and 
wider multilateral agreements in support of lawful and 
responsible behaviour by states, are substantially 
contributing to our ability to understand and respond to the 
threat, resulting in a better defended UK. 

 
• Our defence and deterrence measures, alongside our 

country-specific strategies, are making the UK a harder 
target for hostile foreign actors and cyber terrorists to 
succeed against. 

 
• Improved understanding of the cyber threat from hostile 

foreign and terrorist actors, through identification and 
investigation of cyber terrorism threats to the UK. 

 
• Ensuring that terrorist cyber capability remains low in the 

long term, through close monitoring of capability, and 
disruption of terrorist cyber potential and activity at the 
earliest opportunity. 

 
• The UK is a world leader in offensive cyber capability. 
•  The UK has established a pipeline of skills and expertise to 
 
 

develop and deploy our sovereign offensive cyber capabilities. 

• Our sovereign cryptographic capabilities are effective in 
 
keeping our secrets and sensitive information safe from 
unauthorised disclosure. 

 
• We are having a greater disruptive effect on cyber criminals 

attacking the UK, with increased numbers of arrests and 
convictions, and larger numbers of criminal networks 
dismantled as a result of law enforcement intervention. 
•  Improved law enforcement capability, including: capacity 
 
 
and skills for both dedicated specialists and mainstream 
 
officers; and enhanced overseas law enforcement capability. 

• Improved effectiveness, and increased scale, of early 
 
intervention (“PREVENT”) measures is dissuading and 
reforming offenders. 

• A reduction in low-level cyber offences as a result of cyber 
 
criminal services being harder to access and less effective. 

3.	  The UK has 

 

the capability 
to manage and 
respond effectively 
to cyber incidents 
to reduce the harm 
they cause to the 
UK and counter 
cyber adversaries. 

 
• A higher proportion of incidents are reported to the 

authorities, leading to a better understanding of the size 
and scale of the threat. 

 
• Cyber incidents are managed more effectively, efficiently 

and comprehensively, as a result of the creation of the 
National Cyber Security Centre as a centralised incident 
reporting and response mechanism. 

• We will address the root causes of attacks at a national 
 
level, reducing the occurrence of repeated exploitation 
across multiple victims and sectors.
