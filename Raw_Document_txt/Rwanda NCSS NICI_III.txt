Executive Summary 
 
Global ICT policies have become more mainstream in the last decade underpinning growth, jobs, 
increasing  productivity,  enhancing  the  delivery  of  public  and  private  services,  and  achieving 
broad socio-economic objectives in the areas of healthcare, education, climate change, energy, 
employment  and  social  development.  As  such,  the  global  ICT  industry  is  fast  changing  as  a 
result of emerging technologies, economic, social and business trends. As ICT applications and 
services  are  becoming  ubiquitous,  they  are  increasingly  essential  for  ensuring  sustainable 
economic development, and Rwanda is no exception.    
 
Adopted  in  2000,  Vision  2020  aims  to  transform  Rwanda  into  a  middle-income  country  and 
transition  her  agrarian  economy  to  an  information-rich,  knowledge-based  one  by  2020.  The 
Government  of  Rwanda  (GoR)  strongly  believes  that  Information  and  Communication 
Technology  (ICT)  can  enable  Rwanda  leap-frog  the  key  stages  of  industrialization.    As  such, 
GoR  has  integrated  ICTs,  through  the  NICI  process,  as  a  key  driver  for  socio-economic 
development to fast track Rwanda’s economic transformation, and consistently strives to align 
the country’s development agenda to global trends in order to be competitive. 
 
Since 2000 GoR has established institutions and mechanisms to create an enabling environment 
for ICT development, deployed critical world-class infrastructure and is continuously developing 
a skilled human resource base in its quest to become a knowledge-based society and regional 
ICT hub.  Today, the existence of a conducing legal and regulatory framework, availability of 
good infrastructure and a growing and innovative human resource base are further positioning 
Rwanda as a regional ICT hub.  NICI III aims to accelerate “services development” by running 
efficient  government  services  and  increasing  private  sector  productivity  and  in  turn  Rwanda’s 
competitiveness.   
 
Rwanda  strives  to  leverage  ICTs  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy  and  is  registering  tremendous 
progress.    In  2010,  Rwanda  was  the  top  global  reformer  in  the  World  Bank  Doing  Business 
report and second global reformer out of 183 countries in 2011. Rwanda is also the 9th easiest 
place  to  start  a  business  in  the  world  and  the  6th  most  competitive  economy  in  Sub-Saharan 
Africa according to the 2010 World Economic Forum global competitiveness report. This has 
largely been a result of several reforms including online business registration, aimed at making 
the business environment more conducive.  Rwanda’s real GDP growth increased from 2.2% in 
2003 to 7.2% in 2010 with a peak growth of 11.5% in 2008, and an overall average GDP of 7%. 
These achievements are a result of the long-term economic development plan, Vision 2020, its 
medium-term  strategy,  the  Economic  Development  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (EDPRS),  and 
the NICI Plan, which all give a clear direction on how Rwanda will transition from poverty to a 
middle-income, knowledge-based economy.  
 
The  NICI  process,  which  coincides  with  Vision  2020,  begun  with  the  first  of  four  five-year 
rolling  plans,  NICI  I  (NICI-2005  Plan),  that  focused  on  creating  the  necessary  enabling 
environment that would enable the establishment and growth of Rwanda’s ICT sector.  Emphasis 
was  placed  on  establishing  the  appropriate  institutional,  legal  and  regulatory  framework, 
liberalization of the telecoms market, and reduction of entry barriers to the telecom market as 
well as an effective implementation and coordination mechanism.

The just concluded second plan, NICI II (NICI-2010 Plan), focused on providing world-class 
communications  infrastructure  that  will  serve  as  the  backbone  for  current  and  future 
communications  requirements.  Today,  Rwanda  enjoys  increased  nationwide  coverage  of 
telecommunication  networks,  has  deployed  a  versatile  and  high  capacity  national  optic  fiber 
backbone  network,  and  a  national  data  center.    Rwanda  is  now  well  positioned  to  become  a 

regional ICT hub that can offer a wide range of competitive ICT products and services.	  	  	  

 
The  third  plan,  NICI  III  (NICI-2015  Plan),  will  focus  on  the  development  of  services  by 
leveraging ICTs to improve service delivery to citizens, as Rwanda approaches the fourth and 
final phase of the NICI process that will propel Rwanda to achieve Vision 2020 goals.  Lessons 
learned  (Appendix  1)  during  NICI  II  implementation  have  been  widely  considered  in  the 
development of NICIII.  In this phase, emphasis will be placed on the development of services 
in the following five focus areas: 
 

  Skills development aims to develop a high quality skill and knowledge base leveraging 

These focus areas will accelerate services development and fuel continued growth. 
 
This document is divided into the following four parts: 
 
Part 1 sets out the overview of the NICI process since its inception in 2000. It also provides a 
background  of  Rwanda’s  current  ICT  status  in  relation  to  the  global  context:  national 
development strategies, ICT vision, achievements, challenges and opportunities. 
 
Part 2 highlights the methodology employed in NICI III formulation and provides the rationale, 
description, mission and objectives for each of the five focus areas. 
 
Part 3 elaborates each NICI III project by outlining its purpose, description, activities, expected 
outcomes  and  outcome  indicators.    The  projects  defined  will  be  implemented  in  the  first  two 
years of the NICI III plan (FY 2011 and FY 2012).  
  
Part 4 describes the institutional and implementation framework for NICI III, including specific 
roles and responsibilities, and the framework that will guide the development of projects in the 
second phase of NICI III i.e. FY2013 - 2015.  
 
Part 5 is the conclusion. 
 
Implementation  of  NICI  III  projects  will  commence  in  July  2011  and  have  annual/biennial 
project cycles. NICI II evaluation revealed that lack of ownership, inadequate project planning 
and coordination, and monitoring and evaluation were major shortcomings.  As such, NICI III

has  been  designed  to  solve  these  issues  and  is  more  flexible,  with  clear  outcomes  that  ensure 
alignment  with  overall  NICI  III  goals.    Annual/biennial  project  cycles  will  allow  for  easy 
adaptation  to  socio-economic  changes  and  emerging  technologies.    A  strong  institutional  and 
implementation framework has been created for NICI III and will require full participation of all 
stakeholders as they each have complementary roles.  Stakeholders include: 
 

  National ICT Steering Committee, chaired by MINICT, will provide strategic direction 
for  Rwanda’s  ICT  sector  and  be  the  guardian  of  NICI  III  implementation,  providing 
leadership and oversight.  
 

  RDB, the designated coordination and implementing agency of all GoR ICT initiatives, 
in  partnership  with  project  implementers  and  the  private  sector,  will  continue  to 
implement and oversee the implementation of the NICI III initiatives.  Further, the focus 
area working groups (FWGs) that we were very instrumental in the NICI III formulation 
process will continue to support RDB ensuring effective project implementation. 

 

 

  Project  Implementer  will  be  executing  specific  NICI  III  projects  in  partnership  with 

RDB. 

  On-going  monitoring  and  periodic  external  evaluation  will  objectively  verify  project 

implementation and overall NICI III progress. 

The  next  five  years  will  be  most  critical  to  Rwanda’s  transformation  into  a  knowledge-based 
economy  as  NICI  III  aims  to  accelerate  services  development  and  advance  the  country’s 
development agenda.

PART 1: PREAMBLE 
This section sets out the overview of the NICI process since its inception in 2000. It also provides 
a  background  of  Rwanda’s  current  ICT  status  in  relation  to  the  global  context  and  national 
development  strategies.  It  also  highlights  Rwanda’s  ICT  vision,  achievements,  challenges  and 
opportunities. 
 
 
1.1.  The Current Context 
 
Global ICT policies have become more mainstream in the last decade underpinning growth, jobs, 
increasing  productivity,  enhancing  the  delivery  of  public  and  private  services,  and  achieving 
broad socio-economic objectives in the areas of healthcare, education, climate change, energy, 
employment  and  social  development.  As  such,  the  global  ICT  industry  is  fast  changing  as  a 
result of emerging technologies, economic, social and business trends. As ICT applications and 
services  are  becoming  ubiquitous,  they  are  increasingly  essential  for  ensuring  sustainable 
economic development, and Rwanda is no exception.    
 
Investing in ICT is a key driver of economic development for emerging and developed markets 
alike. Figure 1 illustrates the correlation between ICT readiness – the availability of broadband, 
computers, and software in a country – and competitiveness. Countries with the most advanced 
ICT  sectors  present  the  highest  levels  of  competitiveness,  suggesting  that  having  a  country 
enabled by ICT improves its overall economic performance in the long run.1

the NICI Plan, which all give a clear direction on how Rwanda will transition from poverty to a 
middle-income, knowledge-based economy.  
 
In 2007, Rwanda took a key step toward its long-term goal when it became the 1st East African 
country and the 3rd in Africa to adopt the “One Laptop Per Child” program. This initiative aims 
to  provide  pupils  with  laptops  in  order  to  bridge  the  global  digital  divide.    With  the  above-
mentioned  achievements  among  many  more,  Rwanda  is  now  on  track  to  achieving  MDG  and 
Vision 2020 goals.  

	  

1.1.1.  ICT Trends 

Internet: In just a few decades, Internet is transforming the way we live, work, socialize and the 
way countries develop and grow. Its impact on economic wealth includes the creation of jobs, 
improved  standards  of  living,  and  contribution  to  real  growth.  The  United  Nations  in  its 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) lists Internet penetration as a key metric in efforts to 
reduce  poverty  and  encourage  rational  development.  According  to  a  2011  McKinsey  report, 
more than 2 billion people now use Internet in every country, in every sector, in most companies, 
and almost $8 trillion exchange hands each year though e-commerce and these numbers are still 
growing. 3  E-commerce  websites  such  as  Amazon,  iTunes,  and  Google  Checkout  are 
transforming global business transactions.    
 
Voice  communication  over  the  Internet  (VoIP),  blogging,  Internet  radio,  Internet  television, 
social  networking  sites,  cloud  computing,  and  Internet-based  user  applications  are  all 
contributing immensely to the rise in popularity and acceptance of the Internet as the primary 
communication  method  for  many.4 In  2008,  an  estimated  300  Cybercafés  were  operational  of 
which  65%  were  within  Kigali.  However,  due  to  computer  affordability,  mobile  phone 
penetration and easy connectivity to Internet (Hotspots, 3G modems), that number decreased to

131  in  2010.  In  2010,  40  Broadband  VSAT  companies  were  operational  in  Rwanda.  It  is 
envisaged  that  the  use  of  VSAT  will  be  drastically  reduced  due  to  increasingly  affordable 
Internet resulting from the deployment of broadband through the national fiber optic backbone 
that been rolled out in the country (over 2,300 km).  In 2010, Internet penetration in Rwanda was 
5.3% compared to the African average of 10.9%. From 2008 to 2010, Rwanda registered one of 
the  highest  Internet  user  growth  rates  with  8900%  compared  to  the  continent  growth  rate  of 
2450%  and  the  world  average  rate  of  444%.  In  2010,  more  than  38.9%  of  Rwanda’s  public 
sector  (ministries,  agencies,  provinces  and  districts)  and  34.5%  of  the  private  sector  had  web 
presence.5 
 
Mobile Applications: There is increased demand linking mobile payment systems with online-
based e-commerce and trading platforms globally. Today, there are more than 3.4 million mobile 
subscribers  in  Rwanda  who  are  now  able  to  purchase  electricity  and  airtime  anywhere  at  any 
time  as  a  result  of  mobile  payment  systems.    Rwandan  software  developers  and  telecom 
providers can work together to capitalize on this trend.  

Outsourcing: Outsourcing of help-desk services, desktop management, data-center services, and 
on-the-spot  support  services  are  on  the  rise.  It  is  creating  new  job  opportunities  in  the  IT 
industry,  stimulating  the  need  for  progressive  and  innovative  strategies  to  connect  employees 
from continent to continent.  Nelson Hall, a global outsourcing research firm, estimates global 
demand  for  business  processing  outsourcing  (BPO)  services  at  $250  billion  annually  and  it  is 
projected to increase to $750 billion by 2020. Demand for BPO services in Rwanda is estimated 
at  $50  million,  which  will  increase  to  almost  $200  million  by  2020  with  regional  market 
potential predicted to be $1900 million in 2020.6   
 
Information  Security:  Information  security  is  increasingly  becoming  of  critical  importance 
given  the  need  to  secure  critical  information  currently  available  online.  This  is  a  result  of 
advanced  and  repeated  cyber-attacks  to  government  and  private  companies  that  are  now 
spending  more  on  security  technology,  assessments,  training,  and  certification.7 Rwanda  is 
investing, and must continue to do so, in IT and information security to ensure that Rwandan’s 
information is not compromised.    
 
Cloud Computing: There is a shift in the global service model in which service providers are 
leveraging cloud computing technologies to offer “everything-as-a-service”. This is a new and 
swiftly growing approach to service provision.  Gartner, a leading cloud computing research firm 
estimates that the global market for cloud computing will reach $148 Billion by 2014.  Today, 
Rwanda has constructed a national data center that is fully capable of maximizing the potential in 
cloud computing, paving the way for increased services development.  
 
Green ICT: A host of trends, including rising stakeholder awareness, increasing environmental 
regulations  and  rising  energy  costs  are  causing  many  executives  to  “green”  their  companies. 
Through  reduction  in  CO2  emissions,  the  IT  industry  can  save  billions  of  dollars  and  garner 
more money in electric utilities rebates. Benefits and incentives are being offered to businesses 
in countries like the United States as reducing carbon emissions has become a pressing issue.  
Governments  in  countries  like  Canada  and  South  Africa  are  refurbishing  ICT  equipment.  
Refurbished  computers  are  then  distributed  across  these  countries  to  schools,  libraries  and

registered non-profit learning organizations.  Rwanda can greatly increase ICT penetration and 
utilization through such initiatives.    
 
Convergence: Technological innovation and market demand are driving the ICT sector toward 
convergence.  This  trend  is  lowering  barriers-to-entry;  allowing  service  providers  to  try  new 
business  models;  promoting  competition;  reducing  costs  for  service  providers  and  users,  and 
broadening the range of services and technologies available to users. The growing use of Internet 
protocol (IP)-based packet-switched data transmissions has made it possible for various devices 
and  applications  to  use  any  one  of  several  networks,  and  interconnect  previously  separated 
networks. Service providers around the world are embracing convergence through investment in 
all-IP  networks  –  estimated  to  reach  a  cumulative  total  of  $200  billion  in  2015  –  and  in 
converged  business  models.8 Rwandan  telecom  companies  are  also  following  this  trend  by 
converging voice and data network infrastructure.   
 
In order to compete in an increasingly globalized market place, developing economies need to 
not  only  use  ICT,  but  also  ensure  the  availability  of  ICT  to  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  This 
requires a significant investment in infrastructure, capacity building, and a policy environment 
that fosters innovation and growth.  Rwanda, through the NICI process, has created an enabling 
environment and deployed critical infrastructure for ICT growth and development.  NICI III aims 
to  capitalize  on  this  to  accelerate  services  development  through  ICT  by  running  efficient 
government  services  and  improving  business  efficiency  and  productivity,  thereby  facilitating 
sustainable economic competitiveness for Rwanda.  
 
1.2.  Vision 
 
Adopted in 2000, Vision 2020 provides a set of overarching goals that aim to transform Rwanda 
from an agrarian to knowledge-based economy and achieve middle-income status by 2020.  It is 
the blueprint for the country’s economic development strategies that has the following six pillars 
and three crosscutting areas:   
 

1.  Good governance and a capable state 
2.  Human resource development and a knowledge based economy  
3.  A private sector-led development 
4.  Productive and market oriented agriculture 
5.  Infrastructure development 
6.  Regional and international economic integration and cooperation 

 

 
Crosscutting areas: 

	  

1.  Gender equality 
2.  Protection of environment and sustainable natural resource management 
3.  Science and technology, including ICT 

 
GoR has adopted the following strategies to fast track the achievement of Vision 2020 in three 
priority clusters including economic, social and governance.

Economic Development & Poverty Reduction Strategy 2008-2012 (EDPRS) is the medium-
term framework for achieving Vision2020. It follows Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 
benchmarks and targets, organised in 3 flagship programmes: 

1) Sustainable growth for jobs and exports 
2) Vision 2020 Umurenge – a pro-poor, rural development programme for poverty reduction  
3) Governance 
 
Vision  2020  Umurenge  is  a  highly  decentralised  integrated  rural  development  programme 
designed to accelerate extreme poverty reduction in Rwanda. It is currently being piloted in 30 of 
the poorest sectors, “imirenge” around the country.  
 
The Governance Programme underpins two flagship programmes that provide an anchor for 
pro-poor  growth  by  building  on  Rwanda’s  reputation  as  a  country  with  a  low  incidence  of 
corruption and a regional comparative advantage in “soft infrastructure”. The capacity of local 
government and accountability are strengthened, and a business-friendly, risk-free environment 
promoted.9 
 
The most recent Government 7-year plan (2010-2017) focuses on private sector development 
and job creation; good governance and zero-tolerance of corruption; economic growth combined 
with  poverty  reduction;  capacity  building  in  all  sectors,  and  transformation  of  the  agriculture 
sector – especially increasing the use of technology and thus productivity. 
 
In line with Vision 2020, GoR integrated ICT as a key driver for socio-economic development 
by  adopting  the  Rwanda  ICT  for  Development  (ICT4D)  policy,  commonly  known  as  the 
National  Information  and  Communication  Infrastructure  Plan  (NICI).    The  NICI  plan,  which 
started in 2001, aims at fast tracking Rwanda’s transformation to a knowledge-based society. Its 
objectives are to:  

Improve the civil and public service efficiency  

•  Transform Rwanda into an IT-literate nation  
•  Promote and encourage the deployment and utilization of ICTs within the society 
• 
•  Develop the information and communications infrastructure of Rwanda 
•  Make Rwanda a regional ICT hub  
•  Transform  the  educational  system  using  ICTs  with  the  aim  of  improving  accessibility, 

quality and relevance to the developmental needs of Rwanda 

•  Empower  Rwandans  by  developing  a  human  resource  base  that  adapts  to  changing 

•  Develop  the  legal,  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  and  structures  required  to 

support the deployment and utilization of ICT 

 
These objectives have been the guiding principles of the NICI process to-date.    

1.3.  Rwanda ICT4D (NICI) Process 
 
In  order  to  transform  Rwanda  into  a  knowledge-based  economy,  GoR  integrated  ICT  in  the 
Vision  2020  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (EDPRS)  to  enable  Rwanda  leap-frog  the  key 

demands of the economy

stages of industrialization and transform her agro-based economy into a service, information-rich 
and  knowledge-based  one  that  is  globally  competitive.    In  1998,  the  Rwandan  ICT  for 
Development (ICT4D) policy was adopted to implement policies and plans that would address 
Rwanda’s  developmental  challenges  in  the  information  and  technology  age,  in  order  to 
accelerate  the  country’s  socio-economic  development.  In  2000  GoR  begun  implementing  the 
ICT4D policy, commonly known as NICI, and subsequently developed and implemented NICI I 
(NICI-2005 Plan), the first of the four five-year rolling plans. Emphasis in NICI I was placed on 
creating  a  conducing  environment  by  establishing  the  institutional,  legal  and  regulatory 
framework for ICT development, putting in place the necessary mechanisms, liberalization of the 
telecoms  market,  reduction  of  entry  barriers  to  the  telecom  market  as  well  as  an  effective 
implementation and coordination mechanism. 
 
The  just  concluded  second  plan  NICI  II  (NICI-2010  Plan)  focused  on  providing  world-class 
infrastructure  as  a  backbone  for  current  and  future  communications 
communications 
requirements.  Several  projects 
coverage  of 
telecommunications  networks,  versatile  and  high  capacity  national  optic  fiber  backbone 
network,  national  data  center  as  well  as  a  centralized  monitoring  and  operations  center  were 
among the accomplishments of NICI II.   
 
The  third  plan  NICI  III  (NICI-2015  Plan)  will  build  on  the  two  previous  phases  and  propel 
Rwanda to the fourth and final phase of the NICI process. In this phase, emphasis will be placed 
on services development across five focus areas identified to fuel continued growth.  This plan is 
more flexible than previous ones in that it allows for easy adaptation to emerging technologies 
and  sectoral  changes.  This  approach  ensures  coherence  and  continuity 
throughout 
implementation  of  NICI  III.  As  such,  projects  will  be  implemented  annually  or  biennially 
compared to the previous plans in which projects had 5-year life cycles to ensure easy adaptation 
to emerging technologies and changing national priorities.   
 
Figure 2 below illustrates the NICI process to date. NICI I and II provided the foundation for 
Rwanda’s ICT development. The third level illustrates the NICI III framework, which focuses 
on five key areas defined as focus areas. The fourth level denotes the fourth plan NICI IV (NICI-
2020  Plan),  which  will  complete  the  NICI  process  by  consolidating  the  country’s  ICT 
transformation.

The  fourth  plan  will  complete  the  NICI  process  by  consolidating  the  country’s  ICT 
transformation. 
 
1.4. 
 
Since the beginning of NICI process, Rwanda has made significant progress towards becoming a 
knowledge-based economy and is now well positioned to become a regional ICT hub that can 

offer a wide range of competitive ICT products and services.	  	    The following achievements have 

ICT Achievements 

been registered in the country’s priority clusters i.e. economic, social and governance:   
 
Economy 
Private  sector:  ICT  initiatives  fostering  Rwanda’s  private  sector  development  include  several 
business  and  career  development  support  services;  online  trade  information  portals;  business 
incubators;  online  tax  calculators;  credit  reference  bureau;  a  land  administration  and 
management  information  system;  electronic  case  management  system;  and  improvements  in 
online  banking  and  e-transaction  regulatory  system.  These  initiatives  have  greatly  improved 
Rwanda’s  business  environment.  In  2010,  Rwanda  was  the  top  global  reformer  in  the  World 
Bank’s “Ease of doing business” ranking, moving up from 143rd in 2009 to 67th, the biggest jump 
ever  recorded  by  any  country.  Online  business  registration  was  key  to  Rwanda’s  improved 
ranking in 2011, where it currently ranks 58th. 
 
Agriculture:  ICT 
the  Agricultural 
Management  Information  System  (AMIS);  an  online  exchange  platform,  “e-Soko”,  a  mobile 
market information solution that allows farmers and consumers to access market information for 

the  agriculture  sector 

initiatives  benefiting 

include

agricultural products.  The e-Soko project won the 2011 public service delivery Technology in 
Government  Award  (TIGA).  A  Land  Use  Management  and  Information  System  has  been 
implemented to ensure proper usage, planning and management of land.  
 
ICT:  Rwanda  has  registered  significant  progress  in  the  deployment  of  world-class  ICT 
infrastructure  that  is  now  connecting  Rwandans  to  global  networks.    The  national  fiber  optic 
backbone network that is connecting Rwanda to international sea cables will facilitate increased 
affordability  and  access  to  Internet  across  the  country.  A  national  data  centre  has  been 
developed,  which  allows  Rwanda  to  centralize  her  information  storage,  management  and 
protection,  as  well  as  take  advantage  of  cloud  computing  opportunities.  Communication, 
Navigation  Surveillance  and  Air  traffic  management  system  (CNS-ATM)  has  been  deployed, 
which  will  greatly  transform  air  travel,  not  just  for  Rwanda,  but  the  region  at  large.  
Broadcasting  masts  that  are  transforming  broadcasting  nationally  have  been  deployed  at 
Rwanda’s highest peak thereby fast tracking Rwanda’s migration from analogue to digital.  Key 
achievements in this sector include: 
 

•  Enactment of telecom law No. 44/2001 of 30/11/2001 as well as the Law No. 39/2001 of 

13/09/2001 establishing the Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Agency (RURA) 

•  Liberalization of the telecommunication industry

1.5.  Challenges and Opportunities 

 

 

 
Social 
Education: GoR has implemented numerous ICT in education initiatives including ICT training 
for  teachers  and  One  Laptop  Per  Child  that  are  transforming  the  delivery  and  quality  of 
education; Science and Technology scholarships that are growing the number of ICT capacity; 
Schoolnet  that  aims  to  improve  connectivity  and  deploy  ICT  tools  in  12-year  basic  education 
schools; RwEdNet that is interconnecting Rwanda’s institutions of higher learning and linking 
them to global education and research networks, and the Rwanda Education Commons a one-
stop  portal  for  education  information.    These  initiatives  are  transforming  and  improving  the 
delivery and quality of education in Rwanda.  
 
Health:  Numerous  ICT  initiatives  have  been  implemented  in  health  such  as:  OpenMRS  –  an 
open-source medical records system that facilitates nationwide tracking of patient data; TRACnet 
– a system that allows central collection and storage of clinical health information; Mobile e-
Health  –  a  system  used  by  community  health  workers  to  collect  data  for  OpenMRS  and 
TRACnet  systems;  Telemedicine  –  that  is  connecting  King  Faisal  Hospital  to  Hospitals  in 
Kabgayi  and  Musanze  facilitating  the  sharing  of  clinical  information  between  urban  and  rural 
hospitals,  and  most  importantly  allowing  citizens  to  receive  specialized  treatment  services 
remotely without travelling to Kigali.  These initiatives are transforming healthcare delivery and 
helping  Rwanda  achieve  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  health,  which  is  earning 
Rwanda critical acclaim world-wide.   
 
Governance 
E-Government: Numerous e-Government initiatives such as the modern and secure National ID 
and  driving  license;  e-Cabinet;  e-Parliament,  document  tracking  and  workflow  management 
system; financial management system (FMS) and human resource management system (HRMS) 
have been or are in the process of being deployed to improve government operations and service 
delivery  to  citizens.    One  of  the  key  tools  introduced  by  the  GoR  in  2006  to  reinforce 
participation  and  accountability  of  local  government  is  performance-based  contracts,  locally 
referred  to  as  “Imihigo”.  Imihigo  is  an  old  cultural  practice  of  Rwanda  where  an  individual 
would  set  him/herself  targets  to  be  achieved  within  a  specific  period  of  time.  Through  this 
approach, local governments and communities set their own priorities and strategies to achieve 
their goals. Furthermore, hundreds of local government officials and citizens have been trained 
in ICTs to promote ICT literacy and citizen participation in the country’s development.   These 
initiatives will most certainly improve government-to-citizen (G2C) services and facilitate more 
development in the governance cluster.  

The  principle  that  guides  this  strategy  is  that  Rwanda  should  not  only  be  a  consumer  of  ICT 
goods and services, but also an active producer and developer of cutting-edge technology and 
high  value  services.    However,  numerous  challenges  still  hinder  Rwanda’s  ICT  development. 
NICI  III  aims  to  address  these  challenges  and  presents  opportunities  that  Rwanda  can  take 
advantage of over the next five years to fast track the achievement of Vision 2020 goals.    
  
Energy:  Energy  access  and  high  costs  are  a  major  impediment  to  Rwanda’s  industry  and 
services  sectors.  The  country  has  low  per  capita  electricity  consumption  relative  to  the  East 
African Community with only 13% of the population having access to electricity, moreover with 
power outages. Electricity generation costs are high as well as the feed-in tariff of power that

currently stands at 112 RWF/Kwh for households and RWF 102/kWh for industries, despite GoR 
subsidizing  the  utility.    Rwanda’s  electricity  costs  of  $0.24/Kwh,  almost  double  that  of  its 
neighbours. 64% of businesses surveyed in the 2008 business investment climate survey cited 
access and cost of electricity as a major constraint.  As Rwanda strives to increase electricity 
generation,  ICTs  can  be  leveraged  to  consolidate  Rwanda’s  energy  sources  in  order  to  enable 
sustainable energy generation, transmission and distribution through a SMART Electricity Grid 
and Energy Market Design.  
 
Limited access to finance: Lending for ICT companies is constrained by costs and risks arising 
from several factors, including: lack of adequate collateral, crowding out by government bonds, 
asymmetrical  information  (caused  in  part  by  limited  private  credit  registries),  and  inadequate 
skills to assess and manage risk.  Limited lending can also be attributed to Rwanda’s low savings 
rate  that  currently  stands  at  8%  of  GDP.    GoR  should  partner  with  financial  institutions  to 
establish special funding mechanisms to foster ICT industry growth.  
 
Inadequate  international  bandwidth:  Rwanda  still  does  not  have  sufficient  international 
bandwidth.    Being  landlocked,  the  country  is  very  dependent  on  neighboring  countries  for 
connectivity, which greatly increases connectivity costs.  More importantly, given that ICT is a 
competitive  industry,  this  dependence  could  compromise  Rwanda’s  information  security  and 
business continuity.  This can be remedied through other links to other sea cables such as those 
from  southern  Africa  as  well  as  satellite  back  up.    Further,  a  virtual  landing  point  can  be 
established locally where telecommunication providers converge and acquire submarine capacity 
that can be distributed through their networks.   
 
Inadequate ICT skills: Rwanda has insufficient skilled personnel in the ICT field to drive ICT 
development.  As  such,  more  ICT  professionals  will  be  trained  and  developed  to  increase 
Rwanda’s ICT skills base.   
 
Low ICT awareness and usage: Most Rwandans are still not aware of the available ICTs and 
their benefits. This is largely attributed to the lack of awareness, insufficient content relevant to 
the  general  population  and  limited  rural  ICT  penetration.  ICT  in  education,  community 
development  and  public  awareness  initiatives  will  be  implemented  to  increase  ICT  awareness 
among Rwandans.    
 
Nascent private sector: Rwanda’s private sector, particularly the ICT sector, is relatively small. 
It is mostly constrained by the high cost of accessing ICTs especially in rural areas, insufficient 
payment systems and a lack of innovation.  Several initiatives will be implemented to foster ICT 
and  ICT-enabled  sector  development  including  establishing  a  Technopole  (an  advanced  ICT 
park),  e-Payment  systems,  a  national  access  network  to  increase  broadband  penetration  and 
Internet affordability among others in order to foster both ICT and ICT-enabled sector growth.  
 
Inadequate information security: Rwanda’s cyber security needs to be reinforced to mitigate 
ever-increasing cyber threats. Cyber security awareness will need to be disseminated and public 
private  institutional  collaboration  strengthened.  Furthermore,  a  strong  policy,  legal  and 
regulatory framework to ensure cyber security and compliance will be required. 
 
Limited interoperability of government systems: Many government systems work in isolation 
of each other, which creates duplication and inefficient resource management.  Most processes 
are  to  a  large  extent  paper-based,  which  creates  unnecessary  delays.  As  such  ICTs  can  be 
leveraged  through  e-Government  initiatives  to  further  improve  government  operational 
effectiveness and efficiency, thereby improving service delivery to citizens.   
 
NICI  III  aims  to  address  the  above-mentioned  challenges  while  improving  Rwanda’s  ICT 
environment and accelerating services development.

PART 2: NICI III Focus areas 
This  section  highlights  the  methodology  employed  in  NICI  III  formulation  and  provides  the 
rationale, description, mission and objectives for each of the five focus areas. 
 
2.1.   Methodology  
 
NICI  III  focus  areas,  objectives  and  projects  were  generated  through  a  wide-range  of 
consultations to ensure ownership of the NICI III formulation process and implementation.  
 
The  formulation  process  began  by  setting  up  the  necessary  structure  and  identification  of  the 
following NICI III objectives.  
 

1.  ICT to contribute significantly to GDP Growth 
2.  ICT to run efficient government services 
3.  ICT to improve business efficiency and productivity  
4.  ICT  to  be  the  foundation  for  long  term  and  sustainable  economic  competitiveness  

(service economy) 

 
This was followed by the identification of challenges hindering the achievement of the above-
mentioned objectives and five focus areas that would address the identified challenges.  
 
Stakeholders validated the above objectives and articulated the mission, objectives, goals, and 
projects for all focus areas. A detailed description of the stakeholders is elaborated in Appendix 
3. 
 
2.2.   Focus Area Rationale and Description 
 
NICI  III  focuses  on  five  key  areas  that  capture  crosscutting  national  challenges  and  provides 
mechanisms through which Rwanda’s ICT vision will be attained. NICI III focus areas are the 
following: 

 

  Skills Development [SD] 
  Private Sector Development [PSD] 
  Community Development [CD] 
  E-Government [e-GOV] 
  Cyber Security  [CS] 

2.2.1.   Skills Development [SD] 
 
Rwanda has a shortage both in terms of the quality and quantity of skilled personnel to drive ICT 
development as well as achieve EDPRS targets to develop required skills for a knowledge-based 
society.  Skills development is a national priority and also a foundation for the achievement of 
NICI III.  This focus area aims to build ICT professional skills and leverage ICTs in education in 
order  to  accelerate  skills  development.  The  scope  of  the  skills  development  is  two  fold;  first, 
build  ICT  professional  skills  that  will  increase  innovation  in  the  ICT  industry  and  enable  all 
sectors of the economy and second to leverage ICTs in education.

President. 

 
Mission: “To develop a high quality skills and knowledge base leveraging ICT” 
 
Objectives 
 
1: (SD-01) Capacity building in ICT  
 
In  order  to  fully  maximize  and  realize  ICT  benefits,  Rwanda  must  greatly  boost  ICT 
competencies and skills. The capacities of the public and private sector as well as civil society to 
utilize ICTs must continuously be developed in order to fast track the country’s transformation 
into a knowledge-based society. 
 
2: (SD-02) Foster Research & Development (R&D) to spur innovation  
 
Technological innovation is critical to ICT and economic development. Currently, Rwanda has 
limited  R&D  and  insufficient  institutional  capacity  to  innovate.  Investment  in  science  and 
technology  (S&T)  and  R&D  is  important  in  fostering  innovation  for  economic  transformation 
and must be part of a larger framework to build S&T institutional capabilities. 
 
3: (SD-03) Improve access to education and training through ICT  
 
Primary, secondary, vocational and tertiary education can be enhanced through ICT education 
and training tools, e-learning, content development and access to educational resources, in order 
to foster innovation.  Since education delivery involves both government and non-government 
actors, ICTs can also be leveraged to ensure efficient delivery of informal education. 
 
2.2.2.   Private Sector Development [PSD] 
 
Entrepreneurship  fosters  innovation,  generates  wealth  and  creates  jobs  thereby  expanding  the 
tax-base  and  increasing  economic  development.  Achieving  Vision  2020  and  improving 
Rwanda’s  competitiveness  hinges  on  private  sector  led  development,  hence  the  need  to 
continuously  improve  the  enabling  environment  to  spur  growth  and  realize  EDPRS  goals  of 
widening and strengthening the financial sector; raising the contribution of services to economic 
development  and  building  an  economic  infrastructure.  Therefore,  a  specific  focus  on  growing 
and strengthening the ICT sector and other ICT enabled sectors is of paramount importance in 
this plan. This focus area will also help address the national priority of developing viable SMEs. 
The scope of the private sector development is two fold. First is to develop the ICT sector and 
second, a competitive and vibrant private sector leveraging ICT. 
 
Mission: “To develop a vibrant, competitive, and innovative ICT / ICT enabled private sector” 
 
Objectives  
 
1: (PSD-01) Support the development of a competitive ICT sector  
 
Today,  the  ICT  private  sector  lacks  sufficient  capital  to  start,  expand  and  develop  businesses. 
This is a key obstacle cited by ICT companies, which requires significant attention. In addition, 
the lack of knowledge and technology transfer and innovation weakens the sector.    
 

Page 22 of 85	  

	  

 
2: (PSD-02) Foster private sector growth through ICT   
 
ICT is an enabler of increased productivity and cost reduction. Therefore, leveraging ICTs will 
greatly empower all key economic sectors i.e. infrastructure, mining, trade and manufacturing, 
agriculture, energy, tourism, financial services thereby increasing their competitiveness.   
 
3: (PSD-03) Increase ICT sector contribution to GDP  
 
ICT has been identified as a key contributor to Vision 2020 yet its economic contribution to GDP 
is not currently quantified. Therefore, it is important for ICT GDP contributions to be measured 
and enumerated to determine impact on economic growth and returns on ICT investments.   
 
2.2.3.   Community Development [CD] 
 
Community  development  is  critical  to  achieving  socio-economic  development  goals.  Though 
broad  in  scope,  in  this  plan  CD  is  a  community-centric  approach  to  the  deployment  of  ICT 
thereby  strengthening  and  developing  communities.  Specific  focus  on  CD  is  imperative  to 
fostering  and  increasing  citizen  participation  in  the  country’s  development.  This  focus  area 
contributes  to  the  realization  of  MDGs  including  poverty  alleviation,  health,  and  education. 
Furthermore  it  contributes  to  the  achievement  of  EDPRS  goals  of  building  economic 
infrastructure and improving health status. The scope of community development is three fold. 
First is to increase ICT access, awareness and usage within communities. Second is to improve 
citizens’  access  to  information  thereby  increasing  their  participation  through  ICT.  Third  is  to 
facilitate the provision of basic services (education and health) to communities using ICT.  
 
Mission: “To empower and transform communities through improved access to information 
and services” 
 
Objectives 
 
1: (CD-01) Promote ICT awareness in communities  
 
A systematic approach to promoting ICT awareness and its benefits is of paramount importance. 
This will undoubtedly increase utilization, adoption, and ownership of deployed ICTs. Therefore, 
increased  ICT  awareness  campaigns  countrywide,  such  as  the  November  2010  National  ICT 
week, newspaper articles, ICT competitions/awards and media campaigns will be necessary. 
 
2:  (CD-02)  Establish  and  institutionalize  ICT-enhanced  systems  to  increase  citizen 
participation and improve access to services and information  
 
Citizen  participation  is  at  the  core  of  economic  development  and  good  governance.  ICTs  can 
greatly  enhance  extensive  participation  by  providing  affordable  and  efficient  ways  to  extend 
services  and  information  to  communities.  This  will  also  greatly  improve  local  government 
transparency and accountability.

3: (CD-03) Improve healthcare delivery through ICT  
 
Healthcare initiatives and services can be more efficiently delivered to Rwandans by leveraging 
ICTs to improve healthcare access and service delivery for all communities.     
 
2.2.4.   e-Government [e-GOV] 
 
E-Government aims to integrate all government processes such that government operates under a 
“ONE  government”  system  in  order  to  improve  service  delivery  to  citizens/businesses.  This 
focus  area  ensures  sustained  improvements  in  government  service  provision  and  delivery  by 
simplifying  Government-to-Citizen  (G2C)  services  to  continuously  improve  the  social  and 
governance  clusters;  Government-to-Business  (G2B)  services  to  continuously  improve  the 
economic  cluster,  and  Government-to-Government  (G2G)  processes  to  continuously  improve 
government efficiency.  The scope of the e-Government (e-Gov) is three fold. First is to improve 
both  government  business  processes  and  communication.  Second  is  to  increase  citizen 
participation in the country’s socio-economic development and third is to improve the legal and 
regulatory environment that enables Rwanda to adapt to emerging technologies. 
 
Mission:  “To improve government operational efficiency and service delivery” 
 
Objectives 
 
1:  (e-Gov-01)  Improve  communication  and  reduce  barriers  to  government  transactions 
through ICT  
 
Barriers  to  transactions  in  government  slow  down  public  service  delivery.  Therefore,  it  is 
imperative that all government institutions establish the appropriate and effective communication 
mechanisms and an institutional framework that facilitates this seamless transition.   
 
2: (e-Gov-02) Streamline government business processes using ICT  
 
Government  can  be  efficient  and  effective  when  all  business  processes  are  streamlined.  The 
deployment and application of ICTs is the most efficient way to transform processes that foster 
efficiency and reduce the cost of delivering services in a sustainable manner. 
 
3: (e-Gov-03) Increase transparency and accountability in government processes through 
ICT   
 
Transparency and accountability are key indicators of good governance. Therefore, it is critical 
that government is more responsive to citizen needs by leveraging ICTs in order to improve and 
increase transparency and accountability.  
 
4: (e-Gov-04) Foster a conducive legal and regulatory environment to allow easy adaptation 
to emerging technologies   
 
ICTs  are  constantly  evolving.    Therefore,  it  is  imperative  that  the  ICT  legal  and  regulatory 
environment  is  flexible  to  ensure  easy  adaptation  to  technological  changes  and  that  Rwanda 
seizes new technology opportunities.

2.2.5.   Cyber Security [CS] 
 
Cyber  security  is  at  the  core  of  a  knowledge-based  society  and  as  such  must  be  a  national 
priority.  It  ensures  secure  management  of  all  deployed  ICT  assets  that  support  all  facets  of 
Rwanda’s  ICT  goals.  To  fully  realize  ICT  benefits,  there  must  be  full  confidence  that 
information  and  communication  systems  are  secure  and  dependable.  The  Internet  exposes 
Rwandans  to  global  networks,  which  are  prone  to  advanced  and  repeated  cyber-attacks.  
Therefore,  Rwanda  must  continue  investing  in  IT  and  information  security  to  ensure  the 
protection and integrity of national information and ICT assets. The scope of cyber security is 
three fold. First is to increase the level of cyber security awareness and protect key ICT assets 
against  attacks.  Second  is  to  build  local  capabilities  to  respond  to  attacks  as  well  as  foster 
international cooperation on cyber security. Third is to create a legal and regulatory environment 
to mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. 
 
Mission: “To secure Rwanda’s cyberspace and information assets” 
 
Objectives 
 
1: (CS-01) Develop cyber security awareness  
 
Rwanda’s ICT infrastructure demands that every Rwandan participate in safeguarding it. Cyber 
attacks can come in the form of virus-infested hardware or casual access to malicious sites that 
cause  serious  harm  to  the  country’s  critical  infrastructure.  Therefore,  to  fully  safeguard  ICT 
infrastructure assets, all Rwandans must learn about ICT security, which requires due diligence.   
 
2: (CS-02) Build Cyber-security capabilities  
 
Building  appropriate  cyber  security  capabilities  is  critical  to  ensuring  that  Rwanda  possesses 
adequate and relevant capacity to counter any attacks. While ICT infrastructure is protected by 
built in state-of-the-art security technology and solutions, it is extremely important that Rwanda 
builds  national  capacity  to  safeguard  ICT  assets,  as  built  in  protection  is  not  sufficient  and 
sustainable.   
 
3:  (CS-03)  Ensure  Rwanda’s  critical  infrastructure  and  systems  protection  from  cyber 
attacks  
 
Rwanda built state-of-the-art ICT infrastructure during NICI II. However, impending attacks on 
the country are of grave concern and pose real and credible threats to deployed assets. Therefore, 
it is imperative that there is adequate planning to ensure mechanisms are in place to counter or 
mitigate future threats.  
 
4:  (CS-04)  Foster  national  and  international  cooperation  to  handle  cyber  crimes  and 
threats  
 
Cyber attacks are increasingly global in nature and as such, it is no longer feasible or appropriate 
to  simply  handle  them  at  a  national  level.  Therefore,  global  cooperation  and  collaboration  to 
safeguard interdependent infrastructure and mitigate the effects of cyber attacks is increasingly 
necessary.   
 

Page 25 of 85	  

5: (CS-05) Improve legal and regulatory environment to ensure and support cyber security   
 
A  conducive  legal  and  regulatory  environment  compliments  this  initiative  to  ensure  efficient 
protection of cyber infrastructure. It is important that Rwanda puts in place an adequate legal and 
regulatory framework to support deployed and changing cyber security measures.

This section elaborates projects by outlining the purpose and description, activities, expected 
outcome and outcome indicators for each project.  The projects in this section will be 
implemented in the first two years of the NICI III plan (FY 2011 and FY 2012).  
 
3.1.   Introduction  
 
This part consists of proposed projects to be implemented in the first two years of NICI III. Some 
projects  are  rolled  over  from  NICI  II  because  they  were  either  not  implemented  or  require 
continuous improvement. As previously mentioned, NICI III projects will have annual/biennial 
cycles to facilitate adaptation to socio-economic changes and emerging technologies. It will also 
ensure that specific outcomes are realized and continuous alignment to overall NICI III goals. 
 
Projects are organized in their respective focus areas and the following details provided for each:

 Figure 6: Skills Development Projects 
 
SD Project 1: ICT Professional Training and Certification Programs   
 
Purpose: To continuously develop a competent and relevant ICT professional base that meets 
international and industry needs in order to accelerate Rwanda’s ICT development 
 
Description:  
Rwanda has a dearth of skills needed to drive ICT development. The private sector identified the 
lack  of  adequate  ICT  skills  and  the  cost  of  professional  ICT  training/certification  as  key 
challenges.    Graduating  students  for  the  most  part  do  not  have  hands-on  training  that  meets 
industry needs thus requiring significant financial resources to train them. Given that the private 
sector is young and has limited capital, it is imperative that government provides the necessary 
support  to  enable  the  ICT  sector  acquire  relevant  skills.    Therefore,  in  order  to  fast  track 
Rwanda’s ICT development and transformation into a knowledge-based economy, there must be 
programs designed to train ICT personnel and campaigns to attract more Rwandans in the field 
of  ICT,  particularly  Technical,  Vocational  Education  and  Training  (TVET)  Institutions.  
Institutions of higher learning such as TVET and Universities as well as the private sector can 
collaborate to ensure the development of industry specific skills.  This project aims to increase 
home grown ICT expertise that meets national, regional, and global ICT needs.   
 
Activities: 
1.  Conduct ICT skills assessment 
2.  Incorporate ICT Professional certification courses in the teaching curriculum for institutions 

3.  Develop  an  ICT  training  programme  to  subsidize  specialized  training  for  Rwandan  ICT

SD Program: EDUNet  
 
Purpose: To increase ICT usage at all educational levels 
 
Description:  
The  EDUNet  program  aims  to  provide  ICT  infrastructure  and  connectivity  for  all  educational 
levels. It integrates several ICT in education projects for primary, secondary, tertiary institutions 
and non-formal education.  
 
SD Project 2: SchoolNet  
 
Purpose: To increase ICT usage in 12-year basic education (YBE) schools thereby enhancing 
teaching and learning through ICT  
 
Description:  
Most  schools  do  not  have  reliable  connectivity  due  to  electricity  problems  and  high  Internet 
costs. This is project, rolled-over from NICI II, aims to provide connectivity in all schools further 
bridging the urban-rural digital divide, and enhancing teaching and learning through the use of 
technology tools and promoting universal computer literacy in Rwanda’s schools. It builds on the 
numerous ICT in education initiatives such as One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project and aims to 
ensure that all primary school students have access to ICT.  To date 110,000 laptops have been 
imported of which 56,000 laptops were distributed to primary 4-6 kids in 113 primary schools 
countrywide. However, numerous challenges still impede ICT advancement in primary schools. 
In  2010,  only  13%  of  primary  schools  had  electricity  and  88%  of  primary  schools  accessed 
telephone  services  through  headmasters’  mobile  phones.  Other  challenges  include  inadequate 
technical support and insufficient resources to meet the demand. Therefore, it is necessary for 
Rwanda to adopt strategies that ensure resources are maximized in order to realize ICT goals.   
 
Activities: 
1.  Enhance and promote ICT utilization in the teaching and learning process with a particular 

focus on technical education 

2.  Provide ICT infrastructure and connectivity to all schools 
3.  Increase availability of quality ICT technical support for schools

PSD Project 1: Establish a Technopole 
 
Purpose:  To consolidate and accelerate the development of Rwanda’s ICT industry  
 
Description: 
ICT  can  diversify  jobs  beyond  agriculture,  provide  new  middle-income  jobs,  drive  the 
development  of  SMEs  and  increase  product  and  service  innovation.  Key  enablers  for  the  ICT 
industry are 1) ICT infrastructure 2) a steady energy supply and 3) skilled human capital. Whilst 
Rwanda’s ICT infrastructure is well developed, significant challenges continue to be the dearth 
of ICT skills, language (English and French) and business/entrepreneurship skills, and continued 
infrastructural deficiencies in energy. The technopole will be a large scale ICT Park designed 
around the above-mentioned challenges by providing much needed infrastructural improvements 
including guaranteed electricity and infrastructure for companies within the park. It will be the 
basis  of  an  ICT  eco-system  that  provides  ICT  firms  with  ready-access  to  world-class 
infrastructure hence facilitating Rwanda’s entry into developing new and emerging ICT products 
and services.

 PSD Project 2: e-Payment Systems 
 
Purpose: To simplify business transactions in Rwanda  
 
Description: 
This project aims to put in place e-payment mechanism to support online transactions thereby 
fostering e-Commerce.  E-Commerce, the online buying and selling of goods and services, is a 
missing  component  of  the  Rwandan  business  environment,  which  is  mostly  cash-based.  Key 
prerequisites for e-Commerce including the electronic transaction and signature law, copyright 
and intellectual property rights law, an e-Payment policy and mobile payments currently exist in 
Rwanda  and  have  laid  a  foundation  for  e-Commerce.  However,  the  lack  of  adequate 
infrastructure; wariness of business and consumers to conduct business electronically; security 
concerns  and  lack  of  awareness  hinder  the  adoption  and  usage  of  electronic  payments.  This 
project also aims to address these challenges.

PSD Project 4:  ICT Business Financing Mechanisms 
 
Purpose: To establish affordable funding mechanisms for ICT companies 
 
Description: 
This  project  will  establish  viable  financing  mechanisms  for  ICT  companies  to  address  the 
financing gap they face at different growth stages. Three funding mechanisms will be established 
including: Project Finance, Trade Finance and Venture Finance.  Project financing will mainly 
focus on providing funds for ICT start-ups through incubations and Grant awards; while trade 
financing will mainly target established ICT companies in need of capital to implement specific 
contracts  by  setting  up  a  guarantee  fund;  and  finally  venture  finance  will  mainly  fund  heavy 
investment projects. 
 
Activities: 
1.  Develop the regulatory framework for the three funding mechanisms (Project Finance, Trade 

Finance and Venture Finance) 

2.  Seek seed/guarantee funding for ICT SMEs

PSD Project 5: Virtual Landing Point 
 
Purpose:    To  increase  Rwanda’s  international  capacity  and  eliminate  additional  costs  of 
acquiring international capacity for operators  
 
Description: 
A  Virtual  Landing  Point  (VLP)  is  a  central  location  where  telecommunication  providers  can 
meet and acquire submarine bandwidth capacity to distribute through their networks. Countries 
bordering the sea generally construct fiber cable landing stations. Being a landlocked country, 
Rwanda cannot construct such a facility. However, a virtual instance of the same is possible and 
would be the point of choice for all international link providers to terminate their networks and 
deliver  their  services  to  local  network  providers.  Coupling  the  VLP  with  the  existing  local 
Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is efficient since operators’ networks are already reaching the IXP 
thereby eliminating additional costs of acquiring international capacity.  
 
Activities: 
1.  Prepare VLP site 
2.  Acquire  and  install  VLP  hardware  (Racks,  Routers,  Switches,  Servers,  Transmission 

equipment) and software 
 

Expected Outcome: 
1.  VLP fully operational by 2013 
2.  Low throughput from VLP to end users 
3.  Simplified international capacity acquisition for telecommunication providers 
4.  Reduction in cost of Internet and a boost in ISP industry 

 

	  

Outcome Indicators: 
1.  50% reduction in wholesale bandwidth costs 
2.  99.5% reliability and availability of bandwidth by 2013 
 
PSD Project 6: Access Network 
 
Purpose: To extend Internet access across the country in order to bridge Rwanda’s digital divide  
 
Description: 
The national fiber optic backbone network has been completed and is available in all 30 districts. 
However, not all end-users i.e. schools, hospitals, government offices, commercial buildings etc. 
are centrally located in districts. This project aims to bridge the gap between the backbone nodes 
and  end-user  premises  by  means  of  wireless  or  fiber.  In  doing  so,  it  is  expected  that  all 
telecommunication  providers  will  expand  their  customer  base  using  the  same  access  points 
thereby increasing their revenue streams while transforming businesses and lives across Rwanda.

CD Project 6: Health Insurance Information System 
 
Purpose: To improve healthcare delivery 
 
Description: 
Health  insurance  plays  a  critical  role  in  healthcare  provision  by  increasing  accessibility  to 
healthcare  services.    In  Rwanda  there  are  two  main  health  insurance  schemes:  RAMA  and 
Mutuelle de Santé, with over 90% Rwandans covered by Mutuelle de Santé.  However, all its 
services  including  authentication  and  claim  processing  are  paper-based,  which  translates  into 
long  reconciliation  processes  between  healthcare  providers  and  insurance  thereby  hindering 
effective  operations  and  in-turn  quality  of  service  delivery.  This  project  aims  to  automate  all 
health  insurance  services  hence  allowing  for  swift  and  seamless  insurance  claims  processing, 
which will greatly improve health care service delivery.

Description:   
Telemedicine  is  an  application  of  clinical  medicine  where  medical  information  is  transferred 
through  audio-visual  media  and  other  technologies  for  purposes  of  diagnosing  or  treating 
patients. This is a rolled over project, currently being implemented in three teaching hospitals 
and two rural hospitals in Musanze and Kabgayi that are connected to King Faisal Hospital. This 
needs to be scaled-out to all health institutions across the country. However, challenges including 
inadequate  infrastructure,  lack  of  connectivity  and  inadequate  trained  staff  still  impede  the 
development of telemedicine in Rwanda. 
 
Activities: 
1.  Develop and deploy telemedicine solutions in selected health facilities  
2.  Provide reliable connectivity and electricity 

Page 46 of 85

The  limited  radio  and  TV  signal  coverage  in  numerous  parts  of  the  country  continue  to 
disenfranchise  Rwandans,  thereby  limiting  their  participation  in  government  development 
programmes. Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommended that 
analogue systems be switched to digital by June 2015. This project aims to leverage deployed 
broadcasting  infrastructure  to  transition  Rwanda’s  broadcasting  from  analogue  to  digital  and 
further current efforts to complete Rwanda’s digital migration. 
 
Activities: 
1.  Enforce and implement the digital migration policy  
2.  Assess market and consumer needs to facilitate market and business development 
3.  Set switch-on and switch-off schedule 
4.  Define system and network standards 
5.  Increase awareness and sensitization around this initiative 
 
Expected Outcome: 
1.  Successful digital migration by 2015 
2.  Increased citizen participation in development programs 
3.  Increased content development 
 
Outcome Indicators: 
1.  50% of Rwandan households migrated to digital by 2013 
 
 
Communication, Navigation, Surveillance – Air Traffic Management (CNS-ATM) 
 
Purpose: To develop a seamless, globally coordinated system of air navigation services that will 
cope with worldwide growth in air traffic demand 
 
Description: 
This project aims to foster the implementation of a seamless, global air management system that 
will enable air craft operators to meet their planned times of departure and arrival, and adhere to 
their preferred flight profiles with minimum constraints and without compromising agreed safety 
levels.  Rwanda  has  been  selected  to  host  the  Communication  Navigation  Surveillance  /Air 
Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) for all COMESA member states and therefore must be ready 
to  effectively  manage  the  system.  It  will  enable  a  regional  unified  air  space  management  that 
would  control  navigation  services.  The  centre  will  be  based  at  Karisimbi  in  the  Northern 
Province, where GoR has deployed communication infrastructure. This project is also aimed at 
ensuring that Rwanda is ready to host regional CNS-ATM.

PART 4: INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK 
This section describes the institutional and implementation framework of the NICI III plan 
including specific roles and responsibilities for each institution and the framework that will 
guide the development of FY2013 - 2015 projects.  
 
4.1.  NICI III Institutional and Implementation Framework  
 
Success of the NICI III Plan will depend on the effectiveness of its implementation.  NICI II 
evaluation revealed deficiencies in project planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation and 
as such recommended the strengthening of planning, coordination and M&E functions in RDB. 
NICI  III  aims  to  address  these  issues  by  creating  a  strong  institutional  framework  to  support 
implementation in order to achieve tangible and measurable outcomes. 
 
NICI III implementation requires the participation of all stakeholders including the National ICT 
implementation  steering  committee,  the  project  implementers,  RDB  as  well  as  a  strong 
monitoring and evaluation component. 
 
The figure below illustrates the NICI III institutional framework.

4.1.1.  National ICT Steering Committee (NISC)  
 
The  NISC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Minister  in  Charge  of  ICT  in  the  Office  of  the  President 
(MINICT) as it is the lead government agency charged with ICT.  For increased accountability 
and  effective  implementation,  a  steering  committee  will  oversee  the  plan.  NISC  will  be 
comprised  of  eminent  Rwandan  and  international  experts  providing  strategic  direction  and 
guidance to the NICI process as well as other GoR ICT initiatives. This will expedite decision-
making, foster and increase participation of all stakeholders. MINICT roles and responsibilities 
are to:  
 

•  Develop and disseminate ICT policies, strategies and programs, and mobilize resources 

•  Oversee  and  coordinate  the  implementation  of  national  ICT  programs  as  well  as 

•  Monitor and evaluate the implementation of sector and sub-­‐sector policies, strategies and 

Institutions and Agencies under supervision. 

for sector programs.  

•  Promote the integration, adoption and use of ICT in all areas of our society and economy. 
•  Coordinate with international agencies and institutions working in the sector of ICT. 
•  Promote institutional and human resources capacities and professional skills development 

programs. 

in the sector. 
 

Given the above roles and responsibilities, MINICT will set the NISC agenda.  NISC roles and 
responsibilities are to:   

•  Balance the demand and supply for ICT to ensure ICT investments are aligned with the 

National ICT vision;  

•  Monitor value delivery to ensure ICT initiatives/projects attain optimum benefits; 
•  Risk management of new ICT initiatives/projects to facilitate transparency and 

understanding of compliance requirements; 

•  Ensure proper resource management to facilitate knowledge and infrastructure 

optimization; and 

•  Performance measurement to track strategy implementation.   

The  NISC  will  report  to  the  Office  of  the  President  to  ensure  accountability  and  effective 
implementation of the NICI plan.  NISC will also collaborate with the joint-sector working group 
(JWG) to review NICI III progress and mobilize resources.  The ministry will form technical and 
policy and strategy committees comprised of national and international experts that will advise 
key national ICT strategic initiatives, and more importantly advise long-term strategic alignment 
of ICT to National goals.  These committees must ensure that projects are implemented taking 
into account the most suitable business models. The roles and responsibilities of the NISC are 
follows:   

•  Bi-annual  review  of  the  NICI  III  implementation  progress  to  ensure  that  appropriate 

improvements are incorporated and aligned with NICI III objectives  

•  Mobilization of resources  
•  NICI III advocacy

Project implementer 
 
The NICI II medium-term review and final evaluation identified lack of project ownership by 
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as a major shortcoming. Accordingly, in NICI 
III, each project will have a nominated project manager/implementer. The project implementer is 
a specific institution in charge of executing specific projects under the NICI plan. The roles and 
responsibilities of the project implementer are as follows:  
 
1.  Creating, establishing and managing project plans while ensuring that projects are completed 

on time and within budget 

2.  Communicate project progress to RDB on a monthly basis 
3.  Control and manage the operational budget 
4.  Coordinate project activities and consult with RDB to ensure project deadlines and objectives 

are met. 
 

4.1.2.  RDB 
 
RDB  will  lead  implementation  of  the  NICI  III  Plan  as  the  designated  coordination  and 
implementing agency of GoR ICT initiatives. The Planning and Coordination and New Project 
Development (NPD) divisions within the ICT Department will assume the functions of the NICI 
III Secretariat given their mandate as follows: 
 

•  RDB  Planning  and  Coordination  division  is  mandated  to  plan  and  coordinate  all  GoR 
ICT  projects  in  collaboration  with  all  relevant  MDAs  to  ensure  implementation  in  a 
harmonised and coordinated manner. 

•  RDB  New  Project  Development  division  is  mandated  to  coordinate  and  oversee  the 
successful  implementation  of  all  GoR  ICT  projects  in  collaboration  with  the  project 
implementing institutions. 

NICI II evaluation identified the lack of capacity within the above divisions as the main obstacle 
to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  NICI  projects.  Therefore,  these  divisions  must  be 
strengthened and equipped with the right resources, particularly the monitoring and evaluation 
and  policy  and  strategy  units  of  the  planning  and  coordination  division,  to  ensure  successful 
implementation going forward.  
 
RDB will work hand-in-hand with stakeholders (focus area working groups-FWG) in developing 
new projects and assessing the progress and outcome of implemented NICI projects. Focus area 
working  groups  comprise  of  subject  matter  experts  from  public  and  private  sectors  as  well  as 
civil society. 
 
The planning and coordination unit will have the following responsibilities: 
 
Project Formulation: 

•  Coordinate new project formulation. 
•  Conduct  research  and  facilitate  FWG  stakeholder  consultations  to  ensure  industry 

participation during project formulation. 

•  Continuous improvement of project toolkits to ensure successful NICI III formulation.

Project Implementation: 

•  Oversee effective management of projects to ensure efficient resource utilization. 
•  Prepare  and  circulate  quarterly  project  status  reports  for  NICI  III  implementation 

institutions to ensure alignment with cluster and project objectives. 

•  Organise FWG meetings to ensure project ownership and smooth implementation. 

 

 

Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E): 
 
Building on international best practices the following M&E activities are proposed: 
 

•  Develop a results-based monitoring framework for all focus area projects  

The recommended M&E log frame structure is as follows: 
 

	  

 

 

•  Select a sub-set of so-called SMART indicators for on-going data gathering and reporting 

(simple, measurable, attainable, reliable, and tractable) 

•  Define precisely the nature and format of the data to be captured 
•  Design data input forms for each project to enable routine capture of indicator data 
•  Plan and initiate periodic (monthly, quarterly, etc.) data collection by relevant 

•  Design and implement a data capture system (excel, access, etc.) and online reporting 

implementing agencies 

format 

•  Gather, validate, capture and report indicator data at regular intervals to ensure 

conformance with project activities, and objective verification of project outputs and 
outcomes 

•  Compile quarterly M&E reports with NICI III implementing institutions for submission 

•  Provide recommendations to the NICI III implementing institutions on how to improve 

to relevant stakeholders 

the implementation process 

  

External Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
RDB should continue to leverage external M&E experts to ensure objective evaluation of project 
outputs and outcomes. This independent evaluation should be undertaken on a yearly basis. The 
external M&E experts will carry out the following functions: 
 

•  Verify  the  M&E  processes  of  the  Planning  and  Coordination  Unit  within  RDB/ICT,

independently evaluate the results of projects under implementation, identify bottlenecks 
in  the  M&E  process,  and  make  recommendations  accordingly,  to  ensure  that  overall 
objectives are attained. 

•  Provide recommendations to the NICI III implementing institutions on how to improve 

	  

the implementation process.  

 NICI III Implementation Framework FY 2011-2012  

 
4.2. 
 
NICI  III  implementation  will  have  annual/biennial  project  cycles  to  ensure  that  the  initiatives 
adapt to socio-economic changes and emerging technologies. This phased approach will ensure 
that  the  identified  projects  are  executed  with  clear  outcomes  that  are  aligned  with  the  overall 
NICI III objectives, focus area mission and objectives.

PART 5: CONCLUSION  
 
Rwanda,  through  the  NICI  process,  has  achieved  remarkable  ICT  developments  in  the  last 
decade  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  and  deploying  necessary  infrastructure  as  the 
foundation  for  ICT  development.  These  achievements  are  unparalleled  among  developing 
countries  and  are  frequently  cited  as  a  best  example  of  a  government’s  strategic  resolve  to 
harness ICTs as a tool for development. June 2011 marks the end of NICI II and the beginning of 
NICI III as Rwanda continues her ICT transformation.   
 
Through  lessons  learned  from  previous  plans,  the  NICI  III  formulation  process  has  been 
inclusive in order to foster ownership of the plan ensuring outcomes are concretely defined. This 
has  been  achieved  through  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders  that  will  be  critical  to  the 
implementation process.   
 
A major improvement to the NICI III plan is the adoption of annual/biennial project cycles.  In 
the rapidly evolving ICT world, it is difficult to capture opportunities and challenges in rigid 5-
year plans. This new approach will ensure that the initiatives adapt to socio-economic changes 
and emerging technologies. This phased approach will also ensure that the identified projects are 
executed with clear outcomes that are aligned with NICI III focus area mission and objectives 
supported  by  a  toolkit  that  can  facilitate  rapid  deployment  of  initiatives  while  capturing  new 
opportunities.   
 
The next five years will be the most critical to Rwanda’s transformation into a knowledge-based 
economy  as  NICI  III  aims  to  accelerate  service  development  and  advance  Rwanda’s  ICT  and 
development agenda.

APPENDICES 

	  

APPENDIX 1: NICI II: KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
1.  NICI Pillars and Projects  

The  large  scope  of  NICI  strategy  &  plan  demands  an  organising  principle.  However,  the  link 
between pillars and lead agencies became more tenuous during NICI II implementation process 
and this was pointed out as a possible reason why the project status varied considerably between 
different pillars. It also may explain lack of coordination under NICI II. In the evaluation, some 
lessons learned for overall plan implementation include: 

•  Lack of a committed leader in each pillar, with the responsibility and authority to guide 

implementation of all the projects within his or her brief.  

•  Lack  of  involvement  of  pillar/focus  area  communities  that  constantly  monitor  and 

support the implementation effort.  

•  Lack of ownership of initiatives by stakeholders. 
•  Lack of close coordination across areas, which would have ensured that dependencies 

and sequencing of activities were appropriate.  

 

 

 

 
2.  NICI Outcomes and Impacts  

While there are many positive stories from NICI II projects, there have been little objective and 
verifiable  evidences  to  verify  these  claims.  NICI  II  projects  had  clear  outputs  but  almost  no 
indicators  to  measure  outcomes  and  impacts.  One  result  of  this  has  been  real  difficulty  on 
carrying  out  an  independent  evaluation  of  NICI  II.  But  more  importantly,  the  lack  of 
measurement at output and outcome levels prevented effective monitoring of progress, financial 
and operational, and evaluation in relation to ultimate goals. This needs to be remedied under 
NICI III implementation process. 
 
3.  NICI Governance  

During NICI I and II implementation, the institution mandated to manage the process (RITA) 
underwent considerable institutional and management change. While in 2008 the mandate and 
functions  of  RITA  was  transferred  to  the  new  Rwanda  Development  Board  under  RDB/ICT, 
organizational restructuring was not complete until recently. This has made it challenging for the 
smooth and coordinated NICI II project implementation. The NICI II evaluation pointed out this 
fact and called for a stable and clear governance structure to be put in place and made clear to all 
stakeholders.  At  the  operational  level,  NICI  II  evaluation  pointed  out  several  challenges  in 
Governance which include:  

•  Detailed  project  selection  and  sequencing  based  on  dependencies  were  not  clearly 

defined. 

•  Lack of staff and changing relations with collaborating MDAs made it very difficult to 

manage and execute an ambitious set of projects.  

•  Project analysis and design was not elaborated – need for results based framework (or 
logical  analysis  framework)  with  objectives,  inputs,  outputs,  practical  indicators  of 
successful achievement of outputs and outcomes, targets for achievement etc.  

•  Lack  of  information  sharing  and  weak  project  management  –  consolidated  project 
management  information  was  not  shared  among  stakeholders  to  improve  relevant 
projects.

4.  Monitoring and Evaluation  

 

	  

While  there  are  M&E  specialists  in  RDB/ICT  and  Ministry  of  ICT  since  2008,  detailed 
recommendations  to  improve  the  M&E  structure  of  the  NICI  II  implementation,  which  were 
offered by consultants working on the EDPRS and subsequently picked up in the NICI II MTR, 
were  not  instituted.  Feedback  from  NICI  II  evaluation  clearly  pointed  out  the  importance  of 
structured M&E to capture real outcomes of the NICI initiatives. The evaluation also pointed to 
the  fact  that  a  coordinated  M&E  approach  between  RDB/ICT  and  MINICT  is  essential  under 
NICI III. 
 
Key Recommendations for NICI III 
 
Improve NICI Governance structure  

• 

Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public institutions in implementing national 
ICT programs. 

•  Facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of ICT program based on socio-economic impact 

factor assessment. 

•  Streamline 

information  sharing  and  knowledge  management  by  decreasing 

the 
transaction  costs  between  government  institutions  and  agencies  through  transparent 
reporting framework. 

•  Strengthen the coordination of public-private partnerships initiatives. 
•  Promote  the  adoption  and  dissemination  of  best  project  management  practices  in 

implementing national ICT planned actions.
