Introduction 

Overview 

This document is the National Information Security Policy. The policy outlines the 
mandatory  minimum  security  controls  that  all  public  and  private  sector 
organisations that use, own and/or operate protected computers, handle official 
communications  and  personal  data  must  apply  to  reduce  their  vulnerability  to 
cyber threats. The use of the security measures mandated by this policy would 
increase the capacity of organisations to endure and recover from cyber attacks. 

 

1.2 

Applicability of National Information Security 
Policy  

As  noted  above,  this  policy  is  mandatory  for  all  public  and  private  sector 
organisations that use, own and/or operate protected computers, handle official 
communications  and  personal  data.  In  accordance  with  the  Computer  Misuse 
Act  2011,  the  term  “protected  computers”  refers  to  computers  used  directly  in 
connection  with  or  necessary  for  Uganda’s  security,  defence,  diplomacy;  law 
enforcement;  communications  infrastructure,  banking  and  financial  services, 
public  utilities;  public  key  infrastructure  and  public  safety.  In  this  policy,  “official 
communications” encompass information that Ministries, Departments, Agencies 
and  Local  Governments  (MDALs)  create  and  process  during  their  day-to-day 
business  activities.  Official  communications  have  lower  security  sensitivity  than 
data handled by protected computers. However, the loss, theft and unauthorised 
disclosure  of  “official  communications”  could  have  negative  consequences  on 
the MDALs. Lastly, “personal data” covers data that relates to an individual.  

 

1.2.1 

Critical Infrastructure (CI) 

In  this  policy,  “critical  infrastructure”  is  the  collective  term  for  all  systems  used 
directly  in  connection  with  or  necessary  for  protected  computer  activities,  the 
handling  of  official  communications  and  personal  data.  This  policy  adopts  the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s definition of critical infrastructure 
(CI). Hence, in this policy, CI comprises of “key systems, services and functions 
whose disruption or destruction would have a debilitating impact on public health 
and  safety,  commerce,  and  national  security,  or  any  combination  of  these.” 
According  to  the  ITU,  CI  encompasses  physical  elements  such  as  facilities, 
buildings  and  equipment  and  virtual  elements  such  as  systems  and  data.  The 
ITU further  observes that the physical and  virtual elements of the infrastructure 
include human aspects such as the protection of personnel and the mitigation of 
the  insider  threat.  This  policy  addresses  all  aspects  of  the  ITU  definition  of  CI 
because it covers governance, information, personnel and physical security. 

 

 

 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

1.2.2 

Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) 

The ITU regards Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) as the virtual element of 
critical  infrastructure.  The  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs), 
that  form  CII,  increasingly  operate  and  control  critical  national  sectors  such  as 
health, water, transport, communications, government, energy, food, finance and 
emergency services; their physical assets and the activities of personnel. 

 

1.3 

Policy Review Cycle 

NITA-U shall review this policy, at least annually, to help ensure that it maintains 
relevance to business needs, cyber threats and approaches for countering them.  

 

1.4 

Structure of National Information Security Policy 

The  National  Information  Security  Framework  (NISF)  comprises  of  five  tiers  or 
levels.  This  policy  is  at  tier  three.  The  policy  presents  a  set  of  mandatory 
minimum-security requirements under four headings or parts, which are: 

  Security governance; 

 

Information security; 

  Personnel security; and  

  Physical security 

 

1.5 

Adaptation of Security Controls 

It  is  important  to  stress  that  the  mandated  minimum  requirements  contained  in 
this  policy  define  baseline  security  controls  only.  In  reality,  organisations would 
have  to  do  more  than  merely  apply  the  basic  security  controls.  As  a  result, 
organisations must adapt the security controls provided for by this policy to their 
circumstances. Adaptation is  inevitable because critical infrastructures reside in 
many  sectors  broadly  grouped  into  health  and  safety,  commerce  and  national 
security.  Therefore,  organisations  acting  through  their  Boards,  must  determine 
the  additional  security  controls  that  they  must  apply  to  mitigate,  to  acceptable 
levels, the cyber threats relevant to their business activities. Boards must reach 
decisions on the level of  security controls appropriate for their organisations by 
considering  their  own  articulated  Risk  Appetite,  business  needs  and  the  value, 
sensitivity and criticality of the information assets under consideration.

Policy Context 

The Government of Uganda (GoU) regards information security as an enabler of 
the  efficient,  effective,  safe  and  secure  delivery  of  public  services.  Information 
security  also  serves  national  security  goals  by  protecting  CII  that  operate  and 
control the above-mentioned critical national sectors and their physical assets.  

 

2.1 

National Information Security Strategy  

The National Information Security Strategy (NISS) described the security risks of 
technological  advance  and  the  risk  mitigation  measures  of  such  advancement. 
The  NISS  recommended  the  creation  of  the  Directorate  of Information  Security 
(DIS) in accordance with the National Information Technology Authority, Uganda 
(NITA-U) Act, 2009. The DIS, which authored this policy, oversees and promotes 
information  security  governance,  risk  remediation  planning  and  response.  The 
NISS also recommended the creation of a National Information Security Advisory 

 

8 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

Group (NISAG) to  advise the GoU on information security governance matters. 
The  NISS  further  mandated  the  creation  of  a  National  Computer  Emergency 
Response Team (CERT) under NITA-U. 

 

3 

Guiding Principles  

The guiding principles below influence actions and decisions within this policy.  

 

3.1 

Top Leadership Accountability 

The first principle is that the most senior person in the organisation must assume 
ultimate accountability for information security. Cabinet Ministers  should ensure 
that MDALs report on their information risk position at least annually. 

 

3.2 

Collective Responsibility 

The  principle  requires  all  individuals  to  accept  a  collective  duty  to  contribute  to 
efforts to ensure that critical infrastructure assets and services obtain protection 
commensurate with their value, sensitive and criticality to their organisations.  

 

3.3 

Personal Accountability 

Individuals must understand and accept personal accountability for safeguarding 
the assets entrusted to them and expect to answer for and/or face sanctions for 
breaching security rules.  

 

3.4 

Risk Management/Proportionality 

Organisations  must  adapt  security  controls  to  their  circumstances  in  particular 
their business needs, risk appetite, value and sensitivity of their information. 

 

3.5 

Secure/Assured Sharing 

This principle requires organisations to apply suitable security controls to enable 
the secure sharing of information regardless of its form and method of transfer. 

 

3.6 

Suitable, Trustworthy and Reliable Staff 

Organisations must only hire staff after verifying that their character and personal 
circumstances are such that they can be trusted with access to vital IT assets.

UNCLASSIFIED 

 

3.7 

Resilience 

This  principle  requires  organisations  to  build  capacity  to  withstand  and  recover 
from cyber attacks and disruptions in a timely manner with minimal damage.

4.1 

 

 

Security Governance 

Introduction 

Security governance focuses on all the activities required to manage a functional 
area namely information, personnel and physical security. This policy adopts the 
US ISO/IEC 27001 Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) continuous improvement model 
to structure all security governance processes as illustrated below. 

 

 

 

Figure 1 – Security Governance and the PDCA Model 

Governance  aims  to  ensure  that  security  programmes  support  business  goals. 
Thus, mandatory minimum security governance requirements are as follows:

4.2 

Policy Statement on Information Security 

Boards  are  supreme  governing  bodies  that  provide  GoU  and  private  sector 
organisations  guidance  on  overall  policy  direction  and  strategies.  Boards  also 
facilitate,  supervise  and  support  management  in  the  implementation  of  their 
mandate  and  strategies.  Given  that  Boards  must  consider  all  the  major  risks 
affecting  their  organisations,  it  is  crucial  that  they  issue  a  policy  statement  on 
information  security.  The  purpose  of  the  Board  statement  is  to  underline  the 
importance of information risk management to effective and secure operations. 

GV1  –  All  Boards  of  organisations  with  critical  infrastructure  must  issue  a 
Policy  Statement  on  Information  Security.  As  a  minimum  requirement,  the 
Statement  must:  (a)  recognise  information  as  a  vital  business  asset;  (b) 
acknowledge  information  risk  management  as  a  business  enabler  and  an 
integral  part  of  good  corporate  governance;  (c)  contain  the  Board’s 
acceptance of ultimate accountability for information risk management; (d) set 
clear direction on information risk management by determining Risk Appetite; 
and, (e) assign management and employees security responsibilities.. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

 

4.2.1 

Issue Policy Statement on Information Security 

The policy statement on information security: 

  Recognises information – in all its forms – as a crucial business asset;  

  Explains why information security matters and outline policy objectives; 

 

Is a Board commitment to protect organisational information from all threats 
– internal or external, deliberate or accidental;  

  Assigns Accounting Officer accountability for information security; and  

  Requires all employees (including contractors) to comply with the Statement. 

 

4.2.2 

Articulate Information Risk Appetite 

Boards  must  articulate  organisational  information  Risk  Appetite.  A  statement  of 
information  Risk  Appetite  states  the  level  and  type  of  information  risks  that  a 
given  organisation  is  willing  to  accept,  tolerate  or  survive  in  the  pursuit  of  its 
strategic goals. The statement must: 

  Explicitly note the Board’s Risk Appetite in relation to information risk; 

  Map the Risk Appetite on a spectrum e.g. low to very high; averse to hungry;   

  Address information risk’s relationship with corporate goals in the same way 

as other risks e.g. legal, financial, operational, compliance and reputational;  

 

13 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Require that all project proposals and plans to demonstrate consistency with 

the Board articulated information Risk Appetite; 

  Be read and understood in conjunction with the risk management strategy; 

  Assign monitoring responsibility usually to the Audit Committee; and 

  Be reviewed, debated and agreed at least annually. 

 

4.3 

Information Security Organisation 

Organisations  must  have  an  effective  organisation  to  manage  its  information 
security  activities.  The  Accounting  Officer  must  establish  such  an  organisation 
with a view of achieving the mandatory minimum-security outcomes below.  

 

GV2  –  All  organisations  with  critical  infrastructure  must  establish  suitable 
information  security  management  arrangements  with  clearly  defined 
accountability  at  all  levels.  As  a  minimum  requirement:  (a)  The  Accounting 
Officer  must  accept  personal  accountability  for  embedding  information  risk 
management  into  the  Internal  Control  system;  (b)  a  senior  executive  must 
assume overall responsibility for information risk management at Board level; 
(c)  organisation  must  establish  a  senior  management  committee 
to 
coordinate  information  risk  management;  (d)  heads  of  business  divisions 
must  assume  responsibility  for  named  information  assets;  (e)  every  system 
must  have  a  single  responsible  officer;  and,  (f)  organisations  must  appoint 
trained staff to security roles. 

 
To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Set  up  an  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  in  accordance 
with  US  ISO/IEC  27001:2005.  The  organisation  shall  also  adopt  the  "Plan-
Do-Check-Act" (PDCA) model to structure all ISMS processes; and 

  Create  an  information  security  organisation  that  is  fully  compliant  with  the 

requirements of US ISO/IEC 27001:2005.  

As a minimum requirement, organisations should distribute roles as follows:  

 

4.3.1 

Responsibilities of Boards & Accounting Officers 

The  information  security  organisation  must  perform  the  roles  below  at  Board-
level: 

  Treat information risk as a corporate-level risk; 

  Review the information risk position at least quarterly; and  

  Explicitly address information risk management in Annual Reports. 

 

 

14 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

4.3.2 

Responsibilities of Information Risk Owner 

The  security  organisation  shall  appoint  a  Board-level  official  to  the  role  of 
Information Risk Owner (IRO) with responsibilities including:  

  Ownership of a plan to foster a culture of information security;    

  Accountability for the organisational risk management policy;  

  Alignment of the risk management programme with business processes;    

  Advising on information risk sections of the Statement on Internal Control;  

  Ensuring that all assets have skilled and empowered owners; and  

  The production of quarterly and annual information risk assessments.  

 

4.3.2.1 

Choice of Information Risk Owner 

It is important to stress that the IRO is a role not necessarily a job title. As such, 
organisations could appoint anyone with adequate standing and expertise to this 
role.  However,  guided  by  the  Presidential  Directive  to  create  a  programme  to 
professionalise  information  security,  the  Chief  Information  Security  Officer 
(CISO)  or  a  similar  title  must  be  the  first  choice  for  the  Board-level  IRO  role. 
Choosing  a  CISO  for  the  IRO  role  would  help  ensure  that  the  Board  receives 
timely  and  effective  advice  about  the  impacts  of  their  strategic  and  operational 
decisions  on  information  security.    Organisations  may  appoint  an  interim  IRO 
during the hiring and/or training of a CISO or similar title to take over the role. 

 

4.3.3 

Responsibilities of Information Asset Owners 

Information asset owners must be heads of division or department and perform 
the following functions: 

  Understand and support the organisation’s security culture; 

  Know what information the assets under their responsibility hold; 

  Know who accesses the assets under their responsibility and why;  

 

Identify and mitigate risks to the assets under their responsibility; 

  Ensure that assets under their responsibility are available for business use;  

  Provide  the  Board-level  Information  Risk  Owner  reasonable  assurance  that 

the assets under their responsibility are secure at least annually. 

 

4.3.4 

Responsibilities of Security Coordination Group 

Led by Board-level Information Risk Owner, the information security coordinators 
must perform the following functions:  

  Ensure that effective information risk management processes are in place; 

 

15 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Approve organisational security policies and standards;  

  Monitor compliance with agreed security policies and standards; and 

  Encourage the professionalisation of all security areas. 

 

4.3.5 

Responsibilities of Operational Security team 

Led  by  chief  information  security  officer  or  similar  role,  the  operational  security 
team must perform the following functions:  

 

Implement the organisation’s information risk policy;  

  Follow approved security policies and standards; 

  Enforce security requirements on all stakeholders including suppliers; and  

 

Identify and report non-compliance with security policies and rules. 

 
 
 
4.4 

Risk Management 

Risk  management  activities  must  show  that  the  Board  and  Accounting  Officer, 
acting with and through the  Board-level Information Risk Owner, are complying 
with the mandatory minimum-security requirements  below on mitigating risks to 
acceptable levels.  

 

GV3  –  All  organisations  with  critical  infrastructure  must  adopt  a  formal, 
consistent  and  policy-guided  risk  management  approach  to  help  ensure  the 
security  of  critical  infrastructure.  Drawing  on the guidance  within  the  NISF,  all 
organisations must: (a) have a suitable information risk policy to address threat 
sources and actors; (b) prioritise risks; and, (c) manage information risks during 
the ICT system's development, acceptance, operational and decommissioning 
and disposal phases. 

 
To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Use  the  Board-issued  information  Risk  Appetite  as  a  guide  for  routine  risk 
management  decisions  to  ensure  that  the  organisation  avoids  taking  either 
too much or too little risk in pursuit of its business goals;  

 

Identify business critical assets and the impact of their compromise or loss; 

  Have in place a Risk Register to record and audit risk management decisions 

by identifying risk owners, residual risk and risk treatment actions; and 

  Comply  with  NISF  guidance  contained  in  the  Security  Standard  No.1  – 
Technical  Risk  Assessment  (SS1)  and  Security  Standard  No.2  –  Risk 
Management and Accreditation (SS2).

Information Security  

Introduction  

Information  and  the  supporting  processes,  systems  and  networks  that  process, 
store,  retrieve,  and  transmit  it,  play  a  vital  role  in  the  conduct  and  success  of 
GoU  and  private  sector  operations.  Therefore,  organisations  must  protect  the 
information  they  handle  internally  and  that  they  share  with  external  partners. 
Assuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is necessarily 
a  corporate-level  concern  because  security  incidents  threaten  organisational 
reputations, legal positions and the ability to conduct business operations.  

 

5.1.1 

GoU information security commitment 

The GoU is committed to: 

  Achieving high standards of Information Security governance;  

  Treating  information  security  as  a  critical  business  issue  and  creating  a 

security-conscious environment;  

  Demonstrating  to  third  parties  that  it  deals  with  information  security  in  a 

proactive manner; and  

  Applying  the  guiding  principles  outlined  in  section  3  such  as  implementing 

controls that are proportionate to risk.  

 

5.1.2 

Applicability of information security requirements 

Uganda  is  determined  to  thwart  internal  and  external  threat  actors  seeking  to 
breach  the  security  of  information  assets  within  the  country.  Therefore,  the 
information security mandatory minimum-security requirements apply to: 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

All  staff  in  organisations  with  critical  infrastructure  including  public  and 
civil servants, contractors, consultants, temporary employees, guests and 
volunteers. The requirements also apply to third parties that access and 
use of information that critical infrastructures handle; 

All types of information i.e. written, printed on paper, stored electronically 
or optically, transmitted by courier or using electronic means, recorded on 
magnetic disk or tape, or spoken in conversation;  

All  information  assets  including  that  which  public  and  private  sector 
critical  infrastructure  organisations  use  under  license  or  contract.  The 
information  can  be  in  any  form  and  recorded  on  any  media,  and  all 
computer  hardware,  computer  software  and  communications  networks 
owned or operated by the organisations or on their behalf; and 

iv. 

Any  device,  regardless  of  ownership  and  including  equipment  privately 
owned  by  public  and  civil  servants,  and  citizens  e.g.,  laptop  computers, 
tablet computers, smartphones, MP3 players, USB storage devices, etc.

However, this is only with respect to the ways in which they connect to or 
access information assets and the activities they perform with the assets.  

 

5.1.3 

Information Security and Security Governance 

The themes contained in “Part 1 – Security Governance” apply to the information 
security functional area in the same way as personnel and physical security. For 
example,  the  information  security  area  must  have  effective  leadership;  adopt  a 
credible  risk  management  approach;  conduct  effective  security  awareness, 
education  and  training;  handle  security  incidents  and  institute  assurance  and 
compliance reporting mechanisms. Moreover, the information security functional 
area  adopts  the  PDCA  continuous  improvement  model  to  all  processes.  The 
mandatory minimum information security requirements are as follows:  

 

5.2 

Information Security Policy 

An  information  security  policy  helps  improve  security  if  published,  enforced, 
audited  and  updated  to  reflect  organisational  requirements.  A  security  policy 
aims to achieve the following mandated minimum-security requirements:  

 

IS1  –  Management  must  draft,  obtain  Board-approval  and  publish  an 
information  security  policy  that  addresses  the  NISF  mandatory  minimum 
requirements  in  terms  of  the  organisation’s  business  requirements,  threat 
environment and risk appetite. As a minimum requirement, the policy must: (a) 
explain how the organisation and supply chain protect information and physical 
assets;  (b)  apply  to  all  the  activities  linked  to  protect  computers;  (c)  define 
acceptance and compliance arrangements by its staff and the supply chain; (d) 
undergo regular review to ensure its continuing relevance. 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, the policy must: 

  Define  the  purpose,  scope  and  approach  to  managing  information  security 

within the organisation;  

 

Identify and assign suitable security roles and responsibilities depending on 
the size, structure, business needs and threats to the organisation; 

  Require the  creation of a manual guiding the implementation of an ISMS in 

compliance with US ISO/IEC 27001; 

  Contain  or  refer  to  a  manual  detailing  how  to  apply  information,  personnel 

and physical security measures consistently across the organisation; 

  Contain or reference a guide that explains the secure working practices that 

all users must adopt to comply with security policies and related documents; 

  Require  the  generation  of  evidence  showing  that  the  organisation  uses  the 

security accreditation process to identify and manage risks to ICT systems; 

  Outline the required business continuity roles, processes and procedures;  

 

23 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Specify penalties for breaching the policy and related security measures;  

  Be publicised and made readily available to all staff; and 

  Specify a review cycle in order to ensure its continued applicability.  

 

 

5.3 

Asset Management 

Organisations  must  achieve and maintain appropriate protection for information 
assets in compliance with US ISO/IEC 27001:2005. Effective asset management 
helps achieve the mandated NISF minimum security outcomes outlined below. 

IS2  –  All  organisations  must  ensure  that  assets  associated  with  critical 
infrastructure  receive  the  level  of  protection  appropriate  to  their  value, 
sensitivity and criticality. As a minimum requirement, all organisations must: (a) 
use approved criteria to create a definitive register of business critical facilities, 
systems,  sites  and  networks;  (b)  designate  a  suitably  empowered  owner  for 
every  asset;  (c)  use  the  Government  Security  Classification  Standard  to 
determine  the  acceptable  procedures  for  labelling,  handling,  transmitting  and 
decommissioning assets; (d) audit the asset register regularly; and; (e) inform 
the Board of the main security risks affecting vital business assets. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Conduct an inventory of their assets drawing up and maintaining a register of 

important assets as a prerequisite to risk management;  

  Ensure that designated divisions own and secure named information assets; 

 

Identify, document and enforce rules of acceptable use of information assets;  

  Label and handle information assets throughout their lifecycle in accordance 

with Security Standard No. 3 – Security Classification (SS3); and 

  Use  the  Business  Impact  Tables  in  SS1  to  determine  the  information  asset 

labelling and handling levels.

Secure Information Sharing 

Secure information sharing is about ascertaining that exchange partners have in 
place security controls that achieve the minimum-security outcomes below. 

IS3  –  All  organisations,  particularly  those  within  and/or  connecting  to 
Government,  must  require  internal  and  external  entities  to  show  compliance 
with  mandated  NISF  requirements  and  approved  security  policies  before 
sharing  or  allowing  connections  to  protected  computer  assets.  As  a  minimum 
requirement, organisations must: (a) identify and record risks involving external 
parties;  (b)  create  information  exchange  policies  and  procedures;  (c)  use 
formal exchange agreements such as codes of connection and memoranda of 
understanding;  (d)  assess  compliance  of  exchange  partners  at  least  annually 
or when required; and, (e) disconnect/end sharing with non-compliant entities. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Ensure that users are fully conversant and comply with approved information 

exchange policies, procedures, controls and relevant national legislation; 

  Use cryptographic solutions to provide users and applications the underlying 
“trust” to operate authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation 
security services to protect collaborative tools and information exchanges; 

  Establish exchange agreements that require parties seeking access to GoU 
and other critical infrastructure to have in place security measures that match 
the security classification and handling requirements for the asset; 

  Ascertain that exchange agreements with external parties are enforceable; 

  Confirm that receiving parties grasp and are complying with their obligations 

to protect information assets appropriately; 

  Adopt  policies  to  handle  information  assets  received  from  foreign  countries 

and international bodies in line with applicable treaties and arrangements; 

  Abide by their own obligations under exchange agreements such as codes of 

connection (CoCos) and memoranda of understanding (MoUs); and  

  Obtain  authorisation  before  granting  third  parties  access  to  information  and

network  of  suppliers,  distributors  and  business  partners.  The  advantages  of  a 
global  ICT  supply  chain  including  competitive  prices,  innovative  products  and 
flexibility. Regrettably, there is clear evidence that global ICT supply chains have 
heightened  system  and  software  risks.  Thus,  supply  chain  security  measures 
aim to help achieve the mandated minimum-security outcomes below. 

IS4  –  All  organisations  must  mitigate  risks  of  intentional  and  unintentional 
supply chain compromise. As a minimum requirement, organisations must: (a) 
establish  consistent  supply  chain  security  processes  with  clear  lines  of 
accountability;  (b)  ensure  that  suppliers  are  subject  to  and  pass  a  national 
security  impact  assessment;  (c)  include  security  clauses  in  service  contracts; 
(d) ensure that the computer networks, products and services supplied do not 
introduce  information  security  risks;  (e)  assess  compliance  with  requirements 
at least annually; and, (f) enforce sanctions for non-compliance. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

 

Identify  and  evaluate  the  security  risks  related  to  outsourcing  or  offshoring 
before letting contracts for critical infrastructure and services;  

  Recognise that they retain accountability for managing their information risks 

even where they outsource ICT systems and services to third parties;  

  Ensure that they are fully acquainted and compliant with the national security 

impact assessment process for ICT suppliers; 

  Abide  by  PPDA  instructions  to  identify,  document  and  incorporate  security 

requirements into outsourcing contracts with suppliers and contractors; 

  Require  contractors  to  present  an  operational  security  management  plan 

outlining their strategy for reducing security risks to acceptable levels;  

  Outline  the  process  for  the  development  and  maintenance  of  procedures, 

processes, instructions and plans for securing the system; 

 

Issue  Security  Aspects Letters  (SAL)  regularly  to  update  contractors  on  the 
security conditions that govern their access to critical infrastructure assets;   

  Require suppliers to obtain approval for physical facilities before the hosting 

of GoU and other critical infrastructure systems and services; and 

  At least annually, obtain independent assurance that suppliers are complying 

with the mandated NISF requirements and other security policies.

Access Management 

Access  management  focuses  on  how  to  control  who  gains  access  to  critical 
infrastructure. At its simplest, access management or control aims to ensure that 
only  business  and  security  requirements  determine  who  accesses  information, 
information processing facilities and business processes. Consequently, access 
control aims to achieve the minimum-security outcomes below.  

IS5 – Organisations must ensure that only users, processes and devices with a 
business  need  and  suitable  security  clearances  gain  access  to  critical 
infrastructure.  As  a  minimum  requirement,  access  management  must:  (a) 
follow  a  formal  access  control  policy  linked  to  HR  processes;  (b)  use  formal 
access  registration  and  revocation  processes;  (c)  require  appropriate 
identification  and  authentication  techniques  for  all  IT  systems;  (d)  enable 
organisations  to  deter,  detect,  resist  and  defend  against  accidental  or 
deliberate  unauthorised  actions;  and,  (e)  enable  regular  review  of  access 
rights. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Define  and  document  business  requirements for  access  control  and  restrict 

access to critical infrastructure to those who satisfy these requirements; 

  Adopt an access control policy that enforces the principle of least privilege; 

  Restrict  and  control  the  allocation  and  use  of  privileges  in  accordance  with 

the Need-to-Know principle; 

  Select  and  apply  a  suitable  access  control  model  amongst  Discretionary, 

Role Based and Mandatory Access Control;  

  Apply the principle of uniform access management i.e. use of authentication 

and authorisation services to control resource use;  

  Have in place a formal process for user password management; 

  Ensure that users are aware of and abide by their responsibilities to maintain 

access controls such as passwords;  

  Enforce recommendations of  access rights reviews e.g. disable users; and 

  Harden  and  lockdown  user  applications  such  as  web  browsers  and  office 

productivity applications to reduce exposure to software vulnerabilities.

Network Security Controls 

Proportionate  risk-based  technical  security  controls  can  help  achieve  the 
mandated NISF minimum-security outcomes outlined below. 

IS6 – All organisations must apply technical security controls appropriate to the 
protected  computer’s  value,  sensitivity  and  criticality.  As  a  minimum 
requirement,  the  controls  must  include:  (a)  a  formally  documented  security 
architecture  providing  end-to-end  network  security;  (b)  the  segregation  of 
networks  handling  information  of  different  business  impact  levels;  (c)  the 
enforcement  of  service  minimisation;  (d) the  use  of  unified  authentication  and 
authorisation  services;  (e)  the  matching  of  security  levels  with  information 
protection needs; and, (f) the adoption of the defence-in-depth principle. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Adopt  a  security  architecture  that  provides  end-to-end  network  security  by 
enabling the detection, identification and correction of security vulnerabilities;  

  Ensure  that  users  only  gain  access  to  network  services  e.g.  web  browsing 

and file upload if they have a legitimate business reason for the access; 

  Enforce sufficient segregation, zoning or variable depth security to separate 
specific areas of the network, groups of information services and information 
systems handling data of different security classification levels; 

 

Implement  boundary  protection  measures  for  shared  networks,  especially 
those  extending  across  organisational  boundaries,  in  compliance  with  the 
access control policy and requirements of the business applications;  

  Enforce network routing controls to ensure that connections and information 

flows do not breach the access control policy of the business applications;  

  Apply the principle of service minimisation consistently across the network by 
disabling services that do not satisfy business and security needs for access;  

  Adopt  solutions  that  use  techniques  such  as  encryption  to  offer  converged 
voice, data and video packets protection appropriate to their security needs;  

  Adopt  the  “defence  in  depth”  or  “layered‟  approach  to  network  security 
through the use of different technical security controls and security products 
to mitigate security threats collectively; and  

 

In accordance with ISO/IEC 18043, install network intrusion detection (NIDS) 
and network intrusion protection (NIPS) devices to monitor network traffic for 
unusual or suspicious activity and prevent cyber attacks; and  

  Build survivability into networks to ensure that technical solutions continue to 
deliver  a  minimum  set  of  essential  functionality  in  a  timely  manner  even  if 
parts of the network are unreachable or have failed due to an attack.

Malicious Code Protection 

Malicious code such as such as viruses, worms, spyware and Trojan Horses are 
popular attack vectors for a range of threat actors seeking to gain  unauthorised 
access to sensitive ICT systems and the information they store and handle. The 
threat actors use e-mail attachments, infected websites, instant messages, chat 
rooms  and  social  media  to  trick  users  into  clicking  on  infected  links.  Malicious 
code exploits vulnerabilities in ICT hardware and applications to breach security. 
Therefore, understanding malicious code risks and applying appropriate security 
countermeasures can achieve the mandated minimum-security outcomes below. 

 

IS7  –  All  organisations  with  critical  infrastructure  must  apply  appropriate 
controls against malicious code. As a minimum requirement, the organisations 
must: (a) assess the risk of malicious code; (b) adopt a malicious code policy 
that considers their business needs and threat environment; (c) deploy suitable 
malicious code detection mechanisms; (d) educate users about malicious code 
risks; (e) ensure that authorised mobile code complies with security policy; and 
(f) address published technical vulnerabilities in a timely manner. 

 
To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Mandate  that  all  users,  regardless  of  location,  abide  by  a  malicious  code 
policy that should, amongst other issues, require the installation of  anti-virus 
or anti-malware software on all devices; update of anti-virus or anti-malware 
software  signatures;  system  scanning;  secure  file  attachment  handling; 
secure file sharing; removable media scans; virus log generation and review;   

 

Identify and block all direct e.g. e-mail attachments, social media, malicious 
websites  and  indirect  e.g.  unauthorised  personal  laptops,  PDA,  USB, 
CD/DVD routes that threat actors could use to inject malicious code; 

  Ensure  that  network  boundary  devices  have  the  capacity  to  check  inbound 
and outbound content for malicious code such as viruses, worms and Trojan 
horses  and  mobile  code  such  as  Java,  JavaScript,  ActiveX,  or  any  other 
executable code with potential to damage networks, applications, and data; 

  Use  measures  such  as  logically  segregated  environments  (i.e.  sandboxes) 

and application-specific controls to manage the execution of mobile code; 

 

Install host-based software to scan, clean, quarantine and raise alerts about 
suspicious files, including malicious websites, prior to access;   

  Provide users suitable security awareness and education about the impacts, 

preventative measures and actions against malicious code attacks; 

  Routinely  patch  ICT  systems,  security  enforcing  products  and  applications 

against known vulnerabilities to reduce exposure to malicious code;  

  Conduct  regular  vulnerability  assessments  to  identify  potential  weaknesses  

that could enable the introduction of malicious code;  

  Build  adequate  capacity  to  identify,  deter,  resist  and  defend  against  known 

and unknown (zero-day) malicious code attacks; and

Portable and Removable Media Security 

Portable  and  removable  media  devices  increase  workplace  productivity  by 
enabling access to corporate network resources anytime,  anywhere.  Therefore, 
the devices are a popular way of gaining access to corporate network resources. 
Apart from devices that organisations that organisations supply, IT departments 
face pressures to accept the trend of bring your own device (BYOD) where staff 
seeks to use personally owned devices at  work. However, the portable devices 
expose  sensitive  information  assets  to  security  risks  greater  than  one  would 
expect  in  office  environments  usually  due  to  the  lack  of  physical  security 
measures.  Thus,  portable  and  removable  media  security  aims  to  achieve  the 
outcomes below by balancing the benefits and risks of mobile devices. 

IS8 – All organisations using portable and removable media must adopt formal 
procedures  to  prevent  the  unauthorised  disclosure,  modification,  removal  or 
destruction  of  assets,  and  interruption  to  business  activities.  As  a  minimum 
requirement,  organisations  must:  (a)  perform  a  formal  risk/benefit  analysis 
before use of the media; (b) as part of a formal policy, require authorisation to 
use and transfer the media; (c) use baseline builds that, by default, lock down 
access to media drives;  (d) encrypt  devices to deter unauthorised access; (e) 
enforce  security  policy  on  media  to  detect  and  resist  unauthorised  use;  (f) 
conduct  user  awareness  training;  (g)  audit  user  actions;  and,  (h)  prevent  the 
holding, storage and processing of sensitive information on personal devices. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Lock  down  host  devices  to  stop  users  changing  default  configurations  and 

thereby enabling malicious actors to execute privileged commands; 

  Use full disk hardware encryption for devices processing sensitive data; 

  Ensure that users understand that maintaining physical custody of the device 

is the best form of defence;  

  Not  allow  the  use  of  privately  owned  devices  to  process,  store  or  remotely 
access critical infrastructure, programs and data except in emergency, short-
term situations where it is not practical to issue official equipment; 

  Define  procedures  for  the  timely  termination  of  emergency  use  of  privately 

owned devices to process, store or remotely access critical infrastructure; 

  Prevent  devices  that  do  not  comply  with  organisational  policy,  such  as  the 

use of hardened configurations, from connecting to the corporate network; 

  Give  users  appropriate  training  in  the  handling  of  authentication  credentials 

such as encryption keys, hardware tokens, smartcards and passwords;  

 

30 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Defend against random and targeted attacks by requiring users to power off 
devices  when  not  in  use;  never  to  leave  devices  unattended;  requiring  that 
users store devices separately from credentials, amongst other measures; 

  Minimise  data  aggregation  risks  by  ensuring  that  user  devices  only  store 

data required to perform approved business activities at any given time; 

  Adopt  anti-virus  or  anti-malware  procedures  including  stand-alone  systems 
(i.e. ‘sheep dips’) to scan portable and removable media for malicious code 
before their use for data import and export; and  

  Make  sure  that  users  are  conversant  with  mobile  device  incident  response 

and reporting procedures such as when to report device loss to the Police.  

 

5.10  Remote Access Security 

Remotely connecting a computer either to another computer or to a network over 
public  networks  such  as  the  Internet  increases  staff  flexibility  and  productivity. 
Staff with remote access can perform general work activities, access e-mail and 
transfer  files.  However,  remote  access  presents  unique  security  challenges  to 
organisations. Firstly, remote access calls for additional security measures given 
that it occurs over insecure public networks. Secondly,  because remote access 
occurs in exposed environments such as homes or when travelling, it increases 
exposure to risks such as theft  of equipment and  information, the unauthorised 
disclosure  of  information,  unauthorised  remote  access  to  internal  systems  or 
misuse of facilities. Therefore, in accordance with ISO/IEC 27002, organisations 
must  not  authorise  remote  access  or  teleworking  unless  satisfied  that  suitable 
security arrangements and controls are in place and that  the measures  comply 
with relevant information security policies. Good remote access security can help 
achieve the following mandated information security outcomes. 

IS9  –  All  organisations  must  implement  appropriate  security  measures  to 
mitigate remote access risks. As a minimum requirement, organisations must: 
(a)  adopt  a  formal  remote  access  policy;  (b)  assess  the  risks,  threats  and 
vulnerabilities  of  remote  access;  (c)  use  security  controls  e.g.  encryption  to 
protect data whilst at rest and in transit; (d) educate users about remote access 
risks; (e) security accredit remote access solution handling classified data; and, 
(e) align remote access policy with incident management plans. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Adopt  a  formal  remote  access  policy  that  defines  roles  and  responsibilities 
for  management,  users,  administrators  and  security  personnel  guided  by 
business needs, conditions, threats and the impacts of security breaches; 

  Demonstrate  that  adequate  authentication,  access  control,  communication 
and  availability  measures  are  in  place  to  reduce  the  risks  of  unauthorised 
access, disruption and modification of remote access solution servers, clients 
and applications in accordance with ISO/IEC 18028-4;  

 

31 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Enforce a remote access policy requirement that users and devices only gain 

access to network services for which they authorisation for; 

  Grant remote access only for as long as is necessary for business purposes; 

  Use  encryption  of  suitable  strength  to  secure  communication  links  and  the 

content that they process against eavesdropping; 

  Encrypt remote access clients  to make them inaccessible if lost or stolen;  

  Ensure that users accept and comply with the Security Operating Procedures 

(SyOPs) for mobile devices such as powering off devices when not in use; 

  Ensure that users know and accept their personal accountability for guarding 
remote  access  devices  against  threats  and  risks  in  insecure  environments 
such as snatching, shoulder-surfing, eavesdropping etc; 

  Provide  remote  access  servers  satisfactory  security  including  protection 
against unauthorised physical access; assured power supply; secure set-up, 
configuration and administration; back-up and recovery procedures; 

  Present a formal risk assessment and obtain approval from relevant security 
agencies before permitting the remote administration of critical infrastructure, 
programs  and  data  from  overseas  locations  given  the  risk  posed  by  threat 
actors and sources such as foreign intelligence services to such access; 

  Ensure  that  remote  access  solutions,  including  contracts  with  IT  suppliers, 
comply  with  applicable  legislative  or  regulatory  constraints  in  particular  the 
Official Secrets Act, 1964 and the Access to Information Act, 2005 regarding 
the  handling  of  information,  which  is  likely  to  prejudice  the  security  of  the 
State or interfere with the right to the privacy of any other person; 

  Submit remote access solutions to a formal security accreditation process to 
provide assurance about the adequacy of information security measures e.g. 
baseline builds; personnel and physical security controls in the context of the 
unique threats, vulnerabilities and risks such solutions face; and 

  Sanitise and dispose of remote access devices in accordance with the NISF 

Secure Equipment Disposal and Re-Use requirements.

Protective Monitoring 

Protective monitoring comprises of technical and procedural measures geared at 
detecting  and  stopping  attempts  to  exploit  information  system  vulnerabilities. 
Organisations  should  take  a  risk-based  approach  to  selecting  the  level  of 
protective monitoring undertaken. Thus, the level of protective monitoring should 
match  business  requirements,  exposure  to  threats  and  risks  and  the  business 
impact of security breaches. The mandated minimum security outcomes outlined 
below would help create an effective protective monitoring regime.  

 

 

 

IS10 – All organisations must implement measures to detect, and tie to users, 
unauthorised  information  processing  activities.  As  a  minimum  requirement, 
organisations  must:  (a)  define  a  monitoring  strategy;  (b)  adopt  an  accounting 
and  audit  policy;  (c)  produce,  and  preserve  for  an  agreed  time,  audit  logs 
recording  user  activities,  exceptions,  faults  and  security  events;  (d)  establish 
procedures  for  reviewing  monitoring  results;  (e)  train  staff  to  interpret 
monitoring results; (f) protect audit and logging facilities and log data; and, (g) 
align protective monitoring with incident management and HR policies. 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Define and adopt a protective monitoring strategy that defines the objectives, 
approaches  and  resources  required  to  support  consistent  organisation-wide 
accounting, audit and monitoring activities;  

  Have  in  place  an  accounting  and  audit  policy  that  complies  with  business 
requirements  for  real-time  security  accounting  and  audit.  The  policy  shall 
help developers and product teams ensure that technical solutions consist of 
suitable  accounting  and  audit  points.  In  addition,  it  should  help  information 
assurance  teams  to  verify  the  extent  to  which  the  implemented  accounting 
and audit features comply with NISF security accreditation requirements;   

  Ensure  that  the  network  security  architecture  contains  suitable  features  to 

identify, record, alert and generate security audit reports;  

  Ensure that accounting activities match the level of logging for each security 
classification.  IT  teams  must  not  deviate  from  the  accounting  requirements 
before  presenting  a  risk  assessment  and  convincing  management  that  the 
new level of logging adequately assures the security of business activities;  

  Standardise accounting and audit log data to ease correlation in accordance 

with ISO/IEC 27002;  

  Have in place effective procedures to review recorded logs and alerts to help 

identify and hold to account those who misuse information assets; 

  Hire and maintain a competent team to administer the technological solutions 

and supporting infrastructures that collect, store and log suspicious events;  

 

33 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Enforce  access  control  measures  guided  by  the  least  privilege  principle  to 
help ensure that no user or application process gains access to accounting 
and audit data without explicit authorisation and a clearly defined role; 

  Deny  system  administrators  the  access  privileges  to  erase  or  de-activate 

logs of their own activities;  

  Separate  accounting  and  audit  logs  that  support  routine  security  activities 
from evidential logs that have legal ramifications because they might contain 
intrusive and confidential personal data and may be admissible in Court; 

  Ensure  that,  where  protective  monitoring  activities  collect  data  of  relevance 
in  legal  proceedings,  it  is  possible  to  verify  and  demonstrate  the  evidential 
weight of the data and ensure its legal admissibility in Courts of Law;    

  Have in place a process for escalating to management representatives alerts 
from real-time accounting and audit systems to enable decisions on whether 
or not to trigger the incident management process; and 

  Update  the  accounting  and  audit  policy  to  reflect  changes  in  the  threat 

environment and results of technical risk assessments.   

 

5.12 

Information Back-Ups 

Achieving the mandated minimum information security outcomes outlined below 
can ensure the integrity and availability of data, software and documentation and 
enable  quick  recovery  from  disasters  or  media  failures.  Back-ups  should  cover 
all information processing environments such as live and pre-production.  

IS11 – All organisations must adopt formal policies and procedures to backup 
and regularly test copies of information and software required to recover from 
major  disruptions.  As  a  minimum  requirement,  organisations  must:  (a)  define 
the required back-up levels; (b) base the frequency of back-ups on the value, 
criticality and sensitivity of data; (c) produce accurate and complete records of 
back-up  copies;  (d)  store  back-up  data  a  safe  distance  away  from  the  main 
site;  (e)  afford  back-up  information  suitable  physical  and  environmental 
protection; and, (f) test back-up media regularly to ensure its recoverability. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Define  the  extent  e.g.  full  or  differential  backup  and  frequency  of  backups 
that  reflect  business  requirements  as  well  as  security  and  criticality  of  the 
information to  the continued operation of the organisation;  

  Regularly  test  back-up  arrangements  for  individual  information  systems  to 

help ensure that they meet the requirements of business continuity plans;  

  Back-ups for critical systems must cover all systems information, applications 

and data needed to recover the entire system in the event of a disaster;

Security Accreditation 

There  must  be  a  clear  plan  to  provide  stakeholders  relevant  information  about 
how  an  organisation  complies  with  the  mandated  NISF  minimum  security 
requirements. Organisations demonstrate compliance with security requirements 
by  creating  a  body  of  evidence  containing  procedures,  processes,  instructions 
and  plans  for  maintaining  the  security  of  an  information  system  throughout  its 
life.  The  mandated  minimum  information  security  outcomes  below  would  show 
that the organisation has identified and addressed major risks to vital systems.  

IS12  –  All  protected  Government  computers  must  be  accredited  to  the  NISF 
Risk  Management  and  Accreditation  Standard.  As  a  minimum  requirement, 
organisations  must:  (a)  accept  and  retain  accountability  for  accreditation;  (b) 
ensure  that  every  IT  project  has  a  senior  responsible  owner;  (c)  define  an 
accreditation  boundary;  (d)  develop  an  accreditation  roadmap;  (e)  create 
accreditation plans; (f) record all procedures, processes, instructions and plans 
for  securing  the  system;  (g)  conduct  suitable  system  acceptance  testing 
notably penetration testing; and, (h) identify through-life accreditation costs. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Adopt  the  US  ISO/IEC  27001:2005  controls  set,  select  appropriate  and 

applicable countermeasures to reduce risks; 

  Agree  with  the  Accreditor,  the  approach  for  measuring  compliance  with  the 

NISF; 

  Show compliance with the corporate policies and legislation applicable to the 

system’s security accreditation scope; 

  Describe how the security accreditation process met applicable business and 

security requirements;   

  Demonstrate  how  the  risk  management  strategy  for  the  system  helped 

establish the business impact of compromising the security of key assets;  

  Assess threats and risks to the information system, develop a risk treatment 

plan and countermeasures against  identified risks; and 

  Present a detailed plan for managing security risks to the system throughout 

its lifecycle until decommissioning.

Personnel Security 

6.1.1 

Introduction 

Employees  are  the  most  important  asset  for  any  organisation.  However,  staff 
could  also  be  potent  threat  sources  and  actors.  Indeed,  changes  in  national 
information security policies worldwide have roots in  high-profile accidental and 
deliberate  disclosures  of  sensitive  national  security  and  personal  information. 
Therefore, it is  vital to reduce the  likelihood of staff exploiting legitimate access 
to critical infrastructure facilities, sites, information and staff for unauthorised use. 
Personnel  security  is  important  in  the  context  of  defending  the  cyber  supply 
chain  against  State  and  industrial  espionage  threats.  This  section  outlines  the 
steps that organisations that use, own and/or operate critical infrastructure must 
take to establish the trustworthiness, integrity and reliability of individuals before 
granting them access to sensitive information assets.  

 

6.1.2 

Personnel Security and Risk Management 

The themes contained in “Part I – Security Governance” apply to the personnel 
security  functional  area  in  the  same  way  as  information  and  physical  security. 
For  example,  the  personnel  security  area  requires  a  credible  risk  management 
approach  as  follows.  There  are  no  guarantees  in  security.  This  is  more  so 
concerning  personnel  security.  It  is  impossible  to  guarantee  that  people  would 
always behave reliably.  For example,  honest individuals experience changes in 
lifestyle,  which  could  affect  their  reliability.  Changes  such  as  new  spouses  and 
starting  a family  could  put  individuals  under financial  pressure  challenging their 
integrity. In  other  instances,  reckless  personal behaviour  and  entrapment  could 
increase susceptibility to blackmail. Therefore, organisations must follow the risk 
management principle and the mandatory security requirement presented in part 
1, to decide the level of acceptable personnel security risk at any given time. As 
a result, mandatory minimum personnel security requirements are as follows: 

 

6.2 

Security Roles & Responsibilities 

National legislation such as the Official Secrets Act, 1964 and newer laws such 
as  the  Computer  Misuse  Act,  2011  generally  aim  to  reduce  unlawful  misuse of 
information,  in  particular  that  has  been  entrusted  in  confidence  to  Government 
officers, employees and contractors. However, it is difficult to enforce such laws 
in Courts of Law if organisations fail to demonstrate that employees, contractors 
and  third  party  users  understood  their  responsibilities.  Achieving  the  mandated 
minimum information security outcomes below would help an organisation show 
that it has taken due care to ensure that the individuals understand expectations. 

 

PS1  –  To  reduce  the  risk  of  theft,  fraud  or  misuse  of  facilities,  organisations 
must ensure that all users understand their information security responsibilities. 
As  a  minimum  requirement,  organisations  must:  (a)  communicate  security 
expectations  to  all  employment  candidates;  (b)  include  security  duties  in  the 
employment contracts that all staff must agree and sign; (c) require staff to sign 

 

 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

and  abide  by  Security  Operating  Procedures  (SyOps)  for  specified  critical 
infrastructure or services; (e) inform staff that non-compliance with the signed 
security  documents may  lead  to  disciplinary  action;  and,  (f)  enforce  sanctions 
for non-compliance including dismissal and prosecution. 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Require  all  employees,  including  contractors  and  subcontractors  to  accept 
their security roles and responsibilities formally. The acceptance shall include 
an  undertaking  to:  (i)  protect  assets  under  their  control  and/or  supervision 
from  unauthorised  access,  disclosure,  modification,  destruction  and 
interference; (ii) comply with security processes and activities; and, (iii) report 
security events or potential events or other security risks to the organisation;    

  Ensure that individuals agree to abide by all GoU and organisational policies, 
standards, protocols and guidelines for protecting information, personnel and 
physical assets against security threats regardless of type and origin; and 

  Confirm that, as part of the HR process, all employees, including contractors 
and  subcontractors,  accessing  and/or  operating  critical  infrastructure  sign 
declaration  forms  acknowledging  their  obligation  to  abide  by  the  Official 
Secrets Act, 1964 and related laws during and after their employment.  

 

 
6.3 

Baseline Security Clearance 

Baseline Security (BS) clearance provides reasonable assurance that individuals 
seeking  access  to  critical  infrastructure  are  reliable.  Therefore,  all  candidates 
seeking employment or contracts in role requiring access to critical infrastructure 
must  undergo  and  pass  BS  vetting  checks.  The  level  of  checks  undertaken 
would  depend  on  business  requirements,  perceived  risks  and  the  value, 
sensitivity  and  criticality  of  the  information  assets.  The  bottom  line  is  that  BS 
vetting checks apply to all users of critical infrastructure. 

 

6.3.1 

Baseline Security Clearance Defined 

This clearance is for individuals that would have access to information up to and 
including RESTRICTED, and/or occasional, controlled and supervised access to 
information  up  to  and  including  SECRET.  Achieving  the  mandated  minimum-
security outcomes below boosts confidence in the reliability of people accessing 
sensitive assets. 

 

PS2 – All organisations must perform Baseline Security checks to ensure that 
the  character  and  personal  circumstances  of  individuals  seeking  employment 
are  such  that  they  can  be  trusted  with  access  to  critical  infrastructure.  As  a 
minimum  requirement,  organisations  must:    (a)  satisfactorily  validate  the 
identity  of  all  applicants;  (b)  confirm  academic,  employment  and  financial 

 

39 

 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

records; (c) undertake criminal record checks; (d) establish that applicants are 
entitled  to  undertake  the  employment  in  question;  and,  (e)  record  and  risk 
manage cases where it is impossible to perform all the required checks. 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Ensure that HR processes do not allow anyone to commence work on critical 

infrastructure projects without undergoing appropriate recruitment checks;  

  Verify the identity of the candidate by conducting independent checks using 
Government  or  third  party  issued  documents  such  as  passports  or  similar 
photographic identity documents; 

  Establish  whether  the  applicant  has  the  right  to  work  in  Uganda  including 

meeting residency requirements based on the sensitivity of the position; 

  Check  the  candidate’s  employment  record  by  validating  the  completeness 

and accuracy of the curriculum vitae; 

  Obtain  satisfactory  character  references  about  the  applicant  e.g.  one 

business and one personal; 

  Establish  whether  the  applicant  is  qualified  for  the  job  by  confirming  the 

claimed academic and professional qualifications; and  

  Based  on  risk  assessment,  determine  whether  the  applicant  is  liable  to 

undergo additional national security vetting described in section 7.4.

National Security Vetting 

A security clearance is a status granted to individuals that allows them to access 
certain information. Security clearance is important for critical positions because 
occupants  of  such  positions  who  successfully  commit  acts  such  as  illegal  site 
access, data espionage, illegal interception, data and system interference cause 
more  significant  damage  to  national  security  and  interests  that  those  in  less 
sensitive positions. Therefore, national security vetting seeks to stop individuals 
wishing  to  subvert  or  damage  the  stability  of  Uganda  from  occupying  sensitive 
positions dealing with critical infrastructure. The national security vetting process 
involves tougher checks than BS vetting using two clearance levels as follows: 

 

6.4.1 

SECRET Clearance 

This  security  clearance  level  is  for  individuals  who  require  frequent  and 
uncontrolled access to information up to and including SECRET.  

 

6.4.2 

TOP SECRET Clearance 

This  clearance  level  is  for  individuals  in  privileged  and  sensitive  managerial, 
technical  and  information  security  roles  who  require  frequent  and  uncontrolled 
access  to  information  marked  or  labelled  up  to  and  including  TOP  SECRET. 
Organisations must keep such roles to a minimum number of staff. It is important 
to emphasise that, in common with all forms of security, national security vetting 
provides no guarantees about the future reliability of  vetting subjects. However, 
effective national security vetting can help achieve the outcomes below. 

PS3  –  Individuals  requiring  access  to  computers  necessary  for  Uganda’s 
security,  defence,  diplomacy,  public  safety,  public  utilities  and  economic 
stability  must  undergo  national  security  vetting.  As  a  minimum  requirement, 
organisations must: (a) submit for security vetting all applicants for roles on the 
list of GoU security vetted positions; (b) not initiate the national security vetting 
process  before  completing  recruitment  checks;  and,  (c)  seek  Security 
Controller advice on the required clearance levels before making job offers. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Create a process to comply with the national security vetting requirements of 

appropriate vetting organisations;  

  Ensure that the Security Controller has the current list of GoU security vetted 
positions  and  that  all  candidates  for  positions  on  the  list  undergo  national 
security vetting before starting work;  

  Ensure that the holding of a valid security clearance is not a routine condition 
for  applying for  posts  or  contracts  on  the  list GoU  security  vetted  positions.

UNCLASSIFIED 

However, in exceptional situations, for example where the clearance process 
would take longer than the contract, organisations might make it a condition. 
Organisations must record the exceptions for audit and legal reasons; 

  Be aware that security vetting can occur either during recruitment or at  any 
stage when business requirements, perceived risks, sensitivity and  value of 
information  warrants  more  assurances  about  the  employee’s  character  and 
personal circumstances;  

  Have a GoU Ministry, Department, Agency sponsor for all security clearance 

applications;  

  Subject to national security considerations and guided by the Need-to-Know 
principle,  the  sponsoring  GoU  entities  should  inform  individuals  when  they 
submit their names for national security vetting;  

  Ensure that candidates understand that, whilst no one is obliged to undergo 
national  security  vetting,  occupancy  of  posts  on  the  GoU  list  of  security 
vetted positions is reliant upon obtaining and keeping a security clearance;  

  Rely  on  risk  assessment  to  determine  the  necessity  for,  and  the  level  of, 
security vetting undertaken for candidates aiming for sensitive positions. For 
example, support and ancillary staff may have to undergo appropriate vetting 
depending on the results of the risk management exercise;  

  For sensitive positions, organisations may in accordance with relevant laws, 
regulations  and  ethics,  evaluate  the  applicant’s  likelihood  to  succumb  to 
pressure  and/or  inducement  to  exploit  their  legitimate  access  to  premises, 
information and staff for unauthorised use by conducting detailed checks of 
the  applicant’s  financial  matters  such  as  credit  references,  assets  held 
individually and with family members, financial commitments, unpaid bills etc;  

 

In  strict  adherence  with  relevant  laws,  regulations  and  ethics,  organisations 
may consider  whether the personal  circumstances  of  the  individuals  such 
as medical and criminal history  as  well as behaviour could pose a security 
risk were that person to gain employment in a sensitive position;  

  Work  with  vetting  organisations  to find  solutions to  delayed  clearances.  For 
example, an employee may work “at risk” for a specified time, as long as the 
individual is being vetted and is working under supervision; 

  Only disclose the information gathered for the security clearance application 
to  organisations  with  a  legitimate  Need-to-Know.  In  addition,  organisations 
must only retain the security clearance information for as long as necessary;  

  Make a risk-based decision on whether to rely on  the security vetting results 
obtained  from  another  organisation  on  a  candidate  under  consideration,  re-
start the vetting process or conduct more checks; 

  Subject  to  national  security  considerations,  have  in  place  a  mechanism  for 

providing individuals reasons for the refusal of a security clearance; 

  Have  in  place  a  policy  for  dealing  with  existing  employees  who  cannot 
continue  in  their  existing  position  and/or take  up  a  new  position  because of 
an  adverse  security  vetting  result.  The  policy  must  address  issues  such  as 
re-deployment and appeal procedures. Additionally, organisations must have 

 

42 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

clear, legal and ethical dismissal procedures for staff who fail a vetting check 
but whose occupancy of positions requires a valid security clearance. 

 

 

6.5 

Ongoing Personnel Security Management 

Baseline and national security vetting checks only  provide assurance about  the 
individual’s security reliability at a given point in time only. In reality, baseline and 
national  security  vetting  occurs  before  the  individual  joins  a  new  organisation 
and/or  changes  jobs.  Both  screening  exercises  may  not  expose  the  vetting 
subject’s  full  susceptibility  to  personal  misbehaviour  and/or  amenability  to 
influence.  Therefore,  ongoing  personnel  security  management  aims  to  achieve 
the mandated outcomes below. 

PS4  –  All  organisations  must  monitor  the  continued  security  reliability  of 
individuals  holding  a  GoU  security  clearance.  As  a  minimum  requirement, 
organisations  must:  (a)  maintain  a  record  of  security  cleared  individuals;  (b) 
ensure  that  only  those  with  a  business  need  maintain  access  to  protected 
computer  assets;  (c)  identify  changes  in  personal  circumstances;  (d)  inform 
individuals  that  failure  to  advise  GoU  vetting  agencies  of  any  significant 
changes  in  personal  circumstances  may  lead  to  disciplinary  action;  (e) 
undertake periodic security appraisals; (f) investigate anything that may affect 
an individual’s suitability to access critical infrastructure; and, (g) sanction non-
compliance. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Maintain up to date personnel security records of security cleared individuals 

as well as refused and withdrawn security vetting applications;   

  Ensure that security clearances undergo regular review and/or when material 
facts  or  changes  come  to  light  to  ensure  that  records  are  updated  and  re-
affirm the individual’s suitability to hold a security clearance at a given level;  

 

Inform national vetting organisations of any security incidents that may affect 
the individual’s continued suitability to hold a GoU security clearance;  

  Submit  individuals  to  pro-active  security  appraisals,  annually  and/or  when 
circumstances dictate, during which the vetting subject shall declare changes 
in  professional  and  personal  circumstances  and  any  security  concerns  that 
might materially affect their suitability to retain a security clearance at a given 
level.  Individuals  must  understand  that  vetting  organisations  would  regard 
any  failure  to  disclose  material  and  security  relevant  changes  to  personal 
circumstances as unreliability to the detriment of their security clearances;  

  Line managers and other staff have a duty to work with HR to identify, report 
and  investigate  significant  changes  to  the  individual’s  behaviour,  personal 
circumstances and attitudes to risk. Common warning signs include drug and 
alcohol abuse, changes in working patterns, lateness etc;  

 

43 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

  Ensure  that  access  control  measures  maintain  adherence  to  the  Need-to-
Know principle to make sure, that all times, individuals only have access to 
premises,  information  and  staff  they  need  to  perform  their  jobs.  In  keeping 
with  the  mandated  access  management  security  outcome,  organisations 
must review the appropriateness of access rights regularly;  and   

  Have in place formal processes for investigating suspected non-compliance 
with security rules. Any such investigations,  legal or disciplinary cases must 
comply with relevant laws, regulations and ethics.

Physical Security

Physical Security 

Physical security is about stopping unauthorised physical access, damage, and 
interference  to  information,  premises  and  resources  by  a  range  of  physical 
security  threats  including  crime,  espionage,  natural  disasters  and  acts  of 
terrorism. It also protects personnel against violence and other sorts of harm.  

 

7.1.1 

Physical Security, Governance and Risk Management 

The  themes  contained  in  “Part  I  –  Security  Governance”  apply  to  the  physical 
security  functional  area.  For  example,  physical  security  also  adopts  the  PDCA 
continuous  improvement  model  to  structure  all  its  governance  processes. 
Indeed,  physical  security  measures  are  more  effective  when  considered  at  all 
phases  of  the  broader  organisational  security  programme.  Physical  security  is 
harder  and  more  expensive  to  ‘bolt-on’  after  the  event.  Physical  security  also 
complies  with  mandated  minimum  security  requirements  on  risk  management 
contained in the Governance section of this policy. Thus, good physical security 
measures match business and security needs.   

 

7.1.2 

Physical Security in Context 

Physical security measures work alongside and indeed are the bedrock of other 
areas  of  security  such  as  information  and  personnel  security.  Physical  security 
represented  the  bulk  of security  measures  in the  mainframe  era. Organisations 
invested substantial sums of money to restrict personnel access, used locks and 
alarms and implemented environmental controls to cool the giant machines. It all 
changed  when  computers  became  cheaper  and  smaller.  For  example,  section 
6.10 shows that remote access increases the risks of equipment and data theft 
because it occurs in exposed environments such as homes or when travelling.  

 

7.2 

Physical Security Perimeter 

This policy requires organisations to put in place an adequate physical perimeter 
around  sensitive  information  processing  facilities  to  stop  unauthorised  physical 
access. A perimeter is the whole area surrounding the building hosting protected 
computer assets including roads, footpaths and any other areas just outside the 
building.  The  physical  security  perimeter  is  the  first  layer  of  a  ‘layered’  or 
‘defence-in-depth’ approach to security that progressively increases the difficulty 
of security controls the closer one gets to areas containing sensitive information 
assets.  As  noted  earlier,  the  physical  security  controls  that  the  perimeter 
enforces must align with business needs and be cost-effective. The costs of the 
controls must not substantially outstrip the impact of loss. If the costs outstrip the 
impact  of  loss,  organisations  should  consider  avoiding  the  risk,  for  example  by 
moving  the  assets  to  data  centres  that  are  easier  to  secure.  By  minimising  the 
risk  of  theft,  destruction  and  unauthorised  access,  the  security  perimeter  can 
help achieve the following mandated minimum security outcomes.  

 

 

 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

PH1  –  All  organisations  must  have  appropriate  security  perimeters  to  shield 
facilities  hosting  critical  infrastructure  against  a  range  of  physical  security 
threats including crime, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. As a minimum 
requirement,  organisations  must:  (a)  allocate  physical  security  roles  and 
responsibilities in particular designate a security controller; (b) conduct physical 
security  risk  assessments  before  site  selection;  (c)  design  into  or  require 
changes  to  a  site’s  security;  (d)  have  effective  access  controls;  (e)  log  and 
review access; (f) prepare for, detect and respond to physical incidents. 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Allocate  physical  security  roles  to  facilities  hosting  critical  infrastructure.  In 
common with information and personnel security, the Information Risk Owner 
shall  have  overall  responsibility  for  physical  security  risk  management  at 
Board-level.  The 
Information  Risk  Owner  should  appoint  a  Security 
Controller  to  oversee  day-to-day  security  aspects  of  a  facility  or  group  of 
facilities.  The  Controller  shall  be  Ugandan  and  either  full-time  or  part-time 
depending on business needs, costs and risks including national security;  

  Have  in  place  a  physical  security  policy  that  describes  in  appropriate  detail 
how  the  organisation  would  define,  apply  and  evidence  physical  security 
controls in all its locations in accordance with US ISO/IEC 27001:2005; 

  Ensure that no classified GoU data is processed, stored or transmitted to and 
from any facility without a full risk assessment and formal approval from the 
GoU client and relevant GoU national security agencies; 

  Choose the data centre site carefully taking into consideration issues such as 
its visibility; proximity to hazards and crime; natural disasters; transportation; 
access to environmental controls and emergency services; 

  Ensure  that  the  site  is  designed  securely  with  careful  consideration  for  wall 
height  and  fire  rating;  ceiling  fire  and  weight  bearing  ratings;  door  and 
window design and strength; electricity and environmental controls;   

  Clearly  define  the  perimeter  and  ensure  that  its  location  and  strength 
corresponds with the security requirements of the assets within the boundary 
and the results of a risk assessment;  

  Ensure that the perimeters are physically sound with no gaps to enable easy 
break-in.  In  addition,  external  walls  of the  site  must  be of solid  construction 
with  all  external  doors  suitably  protected  against  unauthorised  access  with 
control mechanisms, e.g. bars, alarms, locks etc; and  

  Ensure  that  Security  Standard  No.  5  –  Physical  Security  (SS5)  and 
referenced  material  therein  are  the  main  source  of  guidance  on  physical 
security matters. 

 

7.3 

Physical Entry Controls 

Secure areas within information processing facilities must have appropriate entry 
controls to stop unauthorised personnel from gaining access. In keeping with the 

 

47 

 

UNCLASSIFIED 

risk  management/proportionality  principle,  the  physical  entry  controls  in  place 
must be commensurate with business and security requirements. Physical entry 
controls can help achieve the following mandated minimum-security outcomes.   

PH2  –  Organisations  must  use  appropriate  entry  controls  to  protect  secure 
areas  against  physical  security 
threats.  As  a  minimum  requirement, 
organisations must have: (b) baseline security controls such as guards, fencing 
and  external  monitoring;  (b)  access  card  systems  to  identify  employees,  log 
and manage access rights; (c) visitor management processes to enable visitor 
sign-in,  badge  allocation,  escorting  and  pass  verification;  and,  (d)  employee 
management processes including requirement to wear identification and carry 
access cards and the control of equipment movements. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Ensure  that  all  facilities  have  in  place  baseline  physical  access  controls  to 
safeguard information resources therein including an on-duty security guard 
force;  fencing  (i.e.  fences,  gates,  turnstiles  and  mantraps)  and  external 
security  guard  patrols,  outside  Closed  Circuit  Television  (CCTV)  monitoring 
or a combination of both. In addition, organisations must mandate the use of 
access cards for access to buildings;  

  Ensure that all visitors report to the security reception and produce proof of 
identification  before  gaining  access  to  sensitive  facilities.  The  visitors  must 
sign-in and sign-out and must wear an appropriate badge e.g. unescorted or 
escorted at all times;  

  Record the  date and time of entry and departure for all visitors. In addition, 
visitors  must  only  gain  access  to  premises  supporting  critical  infrastructure 
for specific and authorised purposes; 

  Visitors  receive  a  briefing  on  the  security  procedures  of  the  secure  facility 

including emergency procedures;  

  Control  and  restrict  access  to  areas  designated  for  processing  or  storing 

sensitive information to authorised persons only; 

  Have  in  place  appropriate  authentication  controls  e.g.  access  control  cards 
plus PIN to manage and validate access and securely maintain an audit trail 
of all access; 

  Require all staff and visitors to wear visible identification at all times. All staff 
at  a  facility  have  a  duty  to  notify  security  personnel  if  they  encounter 
unescorted visitors and anyone not wearing visible identification;  
 

  Grant third party support service personnel restricted access to secure areas 

or sensitive facilities when required only and monitor the access; and 

  Review, update and revoke access rights to secure areas regularly.

Internal Data Centre Physical Access Controls 

Internal  areas  of  information  processing  facilities  require  additional  physical 
security  controls  because  this  is  where  sensitive  information  is  processed  or 
stored. The internal areas include the data centre, communication and switching 
centres and end-user areas. The areas require more stringent personnel security 
controls  to  safeguard  the  information  processed  therein.  Organisations  must 
develop a general access control policy for use in the data centre to achieve the 
following mandated minimum security outcomes. 

PH3  –  Organisations  must  implement  appropriate  internal  physical  security 
controls to defend critical infrastructure against physical attacks. As a minimum 
requirement,  organisations  must  match  the  value,  sensitivity  and  criticality  of 
assets  with:  (a)  data  centre  classifications;  (b)  data  centre 
location 
requirements;  (c)  infrastructure  and  perimeter  security  measures;  (d)  access 
controls;  (e)  access  control  logging  levels;  (f)  package  handling  mechanisms; 
(g) visitor management systems; and, (h) tape handling approach. 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Classify data centres according to their criticality to the continued operation 
of  one  or  major  business  activities.  The  categories  may  be  as  simple  as  A 
(TOP SECRET); B (SECRET); and C (RESTRICTED); 

  Use the data centre classifications to guide location decisions. For example, 
due  to  their  criticality,  class  A  data  centres  may  be  located  in  a  separate 
building  with  a  fenced  perimeter  etc.  Based  on  business  needs  an 
organisation may specify the minimum distance, for example a Class C data 
centre may be in the same building or city as the production site;  

  Use  the  data  centre  classifications  to  determine  data  centre  infrastructure, 
access  control  and  access  logging,  package,  visitor  and  tape  handling 
requirements. For example, class A data centre may require security staff to 
monitor  activity  via  CCTV,  limited  interior  and  external  visibility  from  the 
computer and motion detection; 

  Ensure that sites processing, storing or handling classified information have 
secure  rooms  with  an  Intruder  Detection  System  (IDS)  installed.  Security 
must respond to IDS alerts in a timely manner; 

  Ensure  that  personnel  only  know  of  the  existence  of,  or  activities  within,  a 

secure area on a Need-to-Know basis; 

  Avoid  unsupervised  working  in secure  areas  both for  safety  reasons  and  to 

reduce opportunities for malicious activities; 

  Physically lock and periodically check vacant secure areas; and  

  Unless  authorised  for  a  business  purpose,  ban  the  use  of  photographic, 
video,  audio  or  other  recording  equipment,  such  as  cameras  on  mobile 
devices in sensitive secure rooms. Based on security needs, users may have 
to surrender such devices at the security desk when visiting secure areas.

Equipment Security 

In  accordance  with  US  ISO/IEC  27001,  organisations  must  protect  equipment 
against physical and environmental threats. The security measures help reduce 
the risk of unauthorised access to information and loss or damage to equipment. 
The measures have strong importance to equipment used offsite. Organisations 
must  also  protect  supporting  facilities  such  as  electrical  supply  and  cabling 
infrastructure. Equipment security aims to achieve the security outcomes below.  

PH4  –  Organisations  must  implement  appropriate  measures  to  prevent  the 
physical  loss,  damage,  theft  or  compromise  of  equipment  and  infrastructure 
supporting  critical  infrastructure.  As  a  minimum  requirement,  organisations 
must:  (a) 
the  access-controlled 
boundaries  of  the  data  centre;  (b)  protect  power  and  telecom  cabling  against 
interception  or  damage;  (c)  use  reliable  electrical  power  supply;  and,  (d) 
manage risks to off-site equipment, information or software. 

locate  all  production  equipment  within 

 

 

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Host  all  production  computer  systems  such  as  servers,  desktops,  firewalls, 

etc in the secure areas of the data centre to prevent unauthorised access;   

  Position  devices  processing  sensitive  data  such  as  displays  in  a  way  that 

reduces the viewing opportunities of unauthorised persons during their use; 

  Protect  power  lines  supporting  IT  services  and  telecommunications  wiring 
against  unauthorised  access,  damage  or  disruption  through tapping.  Where 
possible, locate cabling underground and use protective shielding;   

  Have in place controls to minimise the risk of potential physical threats, e.g. 
theft, fire, explosives, smoke, water (or water supply failure), dust, vibration, 
chemical effects, electrical supply interference, communications interference, 
electromagnetic radiation, and vandalism; 

  Establish  and  enforce  guidelines  for  eating,  drinking,  and  smoking  in 

proximity to information processing facilities; 

  Monitor  environmental  conditions,  such  as  temperature  and  humidity  for 

conditions, which could adversely affect information processing facilities; 

  Have  in  place  measures  to  protect  power  and  telecom  cabling  against 
interception  or  damage  by  installing  lightning  protection  to  all  buildings  and 
fitting lightning filters to incoming power and communications lines; and 

  Address  risk  of  off-site  equipment,  information  and  software  in  accordance 

with the guidelines outlined in section 6.10 – Remote Access Security.

Secure Equipment Disposal & Re-Use 

Organisations  must  have  in  place  measures  to  manage  the  security  risks 
associated  with  the  disposal  and  re-use  of  computer  storage  media  holding 
sensitive information. The measures must cover the sanitisation and disposal of 
storage  assets  into  secure  and  less  secure  environments  for  repair,  exchange 
and  recycling.  Timely  and  cost-effective  secure  equipment  disposal  and  re-use 
procedures can help achieve the following mandated security outcomes.  

 

PH5  –  All  organisations  must  adopt  formal  procedures  to  enable  the  secure 
disposal  and  re-use  of  storage  media.  To  minimise  the  risk  of  unauthorised 
retrieval  or  reconstruction  of  erased  data,  organisations  must,  as  a  minimum 
requirement:  (a)  define  secure  disposal  criteria;  (b)  define  secure  sanitisation 
levels commensurate with information sensitivity; (c) group storage media that 
requires  the  same  treatment;  (d)  define  criteria  to  guide  repair,  re-use, 
exchange  or  physical  destruction  decisions;  (e)  validate  the  success  of 
sanitisation exercises; and, (f) log decommissioning activities. 

 
To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must: 

  Ensure  that  all  media  used  to  store  and  process  sensitive  information  such 
as  networking  devices;  magnetic  disks  and  tapes;  office  equipment;  solid 
state  devices  (SSDs);  and  optical  disks  is  sanitised  and  disposed  of  in 
accordance with organisational policies and procedures; 

  Have in place policies and processes that define secure sanitisation levels to 
help  all  relevant  stakeholders  understand  the  degree  of  wiping  required  to 
provide reasonable assurance that data from a decommissioned asset would 
not be retrieved or reconstructed;  

  Adopt  a process to guide sanitisation activities including asset classification 
verification;  sanitisation  and  post-sanitisation  activities;  validation  of  the 
success of the sanitisation activities and final sign-off; and  

  Ensure that where it is not possible to destroy assets handling sensitive data 
securely,  procedures  are  in  place  to  enable  their  secure  storage  and/or 
return to its owner.
