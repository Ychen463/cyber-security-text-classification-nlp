2012-2017

Towards a Digital Society
and Knowledge-based Economy

Message from the Minister

The world is witnessing a revolution in information 
and communications technology (ICT) the scope 
of which stretches far beyond the realm of the 
sector itself. No country seeking real, sustainable 
development and progress can hope to achieve 
these aims without a strong ICT sector in place 
to drive the necessary change.

In  the  midst  of  this  revolution  in  information 
and communications technology, Egypt witnessed 
a different kind of revolution at the beginning 
of 2011: a peaceful, popular political and social 
revolution.  In  the  25  January  Revolution, 
ICT  tools  and    systems,  and  the  use  of  social 
networks  in    particular,  played  a  major  role 
in  events.  This  revolution  changed  not  only 
Egypt’s future path but also the way Egyptians 
view ICT tools and systems, which have created 
an important platform for expression of views 
and in public affairs. 

Various factors have contributed to boosting the 
role of the internet in politics. In Egypt, internet 
access has expanded significantly over recent 
years among all sectors of society, particularly 
among  youth.  Indeed, there has been a clear 
transformation in internet usage patterns across 
the Arab world in recent years, with a marked 
increase in use of the internet as a means and 
arena for political activity.

The ICT sector, in the next phase, should focus 
on adapting ICTs to find solutions to issues of 
concern to the community. While this process 
has  indeed  already  begun,  the  sector  should 
develop a community vision based on the principle 
that development should occur not only in the 
public service sector but also in the managerial 

approach of the state and its constituent bodies. 
This will allow Egypt to achieve a transformation 
embracing digital citizenship in a technological 
society that in its own way will be as impressive 
and far reaching  as  the  change  brought  about 
by the 25 January Revolution.

I am looking forward to supporting the start of a 
new era for the ICT sector in Egypt, building on 
past successes and lessons learnt. I am confident 
that more Egyptians will join the information 
community,  working  together  to  establish 
the  foundations  of  a  new  economy  based 
on knowledge and sustainable development. 
There  are,  of  course,  numerous  factors  to 
consider  in  maximizing  the  role  of  the  ICT 
sector in development. In this new strategy, we 
have therefore addressed a broad range of actions 
in a framework of collective action, targeting greater 
success and progress for the Egyptian ICT sector 
and for the other sectors of the economy.

I  would  like  to  express  my  gratitude  at  being 
offered the opportunity to take over the leadership of 
the Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology  (MCIT)  at  such  a  critical  stage  in 
Egypt’s history. 

I am pleased to present the National ICT Strategy 
for  2012-2017,  which  results  from  the  vision 
and  efforts  of  an  integrated  team  working  in 
collaboration with various actors in the community. 

I am honored to present this document  to  you 
on behalf of the ministry, and to be part of the 
team  responsible  for  not  only  supporting  the 
future development of the national ICT sector, 
but also for shaping up new Egypt.

7

The Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology is working to support an Egyptian ICT 
sector that plays an active role in facilitating the 
achievement  of  political,  social  and  economic 
goals  during  the  current  stage  of  democratic 
transition  in  Egypt.  MCIT,  therefore,  aims  to 
build  on  Egyptians’  positive  view  of  ICT  tools 
and systems, adapting and developing them to 
serve the requirements of a democratic society. 
This will include the development of applications 
that support digital citizenship, opening avenues 
for community participation in social issues, and 
protecting freedoms and social justice

Vision:
 Towards digital citizenship, and an advanced
 knowledge-based economy and a smooth
transition to democracy

Mission:
To develop a democratic knowledge-based
 society that supports a strong Egyptian
 economy  and  is  based  on  equitable  access
 to  information  and  communications  services,
 guaranteeing  the  digital  rights  of citizens and
 the development of a national industry based
on human talent and creativity

To achieve this mission, four strategic objectives 
have been identified:

Supporting the democratic transition

Promoting digital citizenship and information 
society

Promoting sustainable development

Strengthening the national economy

The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 focuses 
on a number of quantitative targets related to 
important indicators. With regard to supporting 
the  democratic  transition  and  promoting  the 
information community and digital citizenship, 
the aims are to raise the number of high-speed 
internet  subscribers  in  Egypt  to  13  million  by 
2015,  to  have  personal  computers  in  at  least 
40% of Egyptian households within five years, 
and  to  establish  a  national  network  of  1,000 
Technology Homes.

On the development front, targets include 
providing all schools and educational institutions 
with high-speed internet access; promoting the 
use of electronic signature applications in three 
government  agencies;  raising  the  volume  of 
e-commerce by 20%; increasing the proportion 
of e- banking customers using online or mobile 
banking to 30%; and improving Egypt’s ranking 
in the field of Arabic digital content by increasing 
the number of trusted websites by 8-10  %.

With  regard  to  strengthening  the  economy, 
the targets are: to maintain ICT sector growth 
rates of 7-10% over the next five years, while 
increasing the sector’s contribution to national 
income  to  5%;  to  raise  revenues  generated 
from outsourcing services to $2.5 billion and 
from  intellectual  property  to  $1  billion;  to 
expand  the  volume  of  investment  in  the  ICT 
sector by 20% to LE 55 billion; and to boost 
exports of software and embedded software 
within  two  years  to  $500  million.  Another 
important factor is employment, with plans to 
increase the number of professionals working 
in outsourcing to 75,000, in IT to 30,000, and 
in innovation and entrepreneurship to 10,000. 
The strategy also includes the expansion of the 
national network of technology parks to 20, and 
the growth of Egypt Post as a primary savings 
facility by a yearly average of about 15%.

identity  management,  access 

The  strategy  will  be  implemented  through 
a  number  of  strategic  pillars:  International 
Cooperation; ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship; 
ICT  Industry  Development;  Digital  Citizenship; 
Human  Capacity  Building;  Government 
ICT 
Infrastructure  and  Digital  Services;  and 
Telecommunications  and  Postal  Service 
Infrastructure.
The general policies of the strategy cover green 
ICT,  Arabic  digital  content,  cloud  computing, 
digital 
to 
information, e-commerce, mobile applications 
for  development,  manufacturing  of  tablet 
computers for education, open-source software 
and empowering people with disabilities.
The strategic pillars include specific initiatives: 
The  Digital  Identity  Management  Initiative, 
The  Educational  Reform  using  ICTs,  Cloud 
Computing and Tablet Computer Initiative, The 
Arabic Digital Content Initiative, Back to Africa 
Initiative and ICT for Empowering People with 
Disabilities  Initiative  (PWDs).  In  addition  to 
the  high-speed  Internet  Initiative  which  was 
launched in 2011 (eMisr).
In total, the strategy comprises over 40 programs 
and 120 projects.

With  regard  to  access  and  coverage  for  high-
speed internet and mobile services, MCIT aims 
to achieve:

for  fixed 

Geographic  coverage 
internet 
services  for  75%  of  Egyptian  households  at 
2 megabits per second (Mbps) by 2015, and 
90%  of  households  at  25  Mbps  by  2021.
Availability  of  3G  mobile  services  for  98% 
of  the  population  by  2015,  and  4G  mobile 
services for 90% of the population by 2021.
4.5 million households, approximately 22% 
of  Egyptian  households,  subscribing  to 
high-speed internet services by 2015, and 
9 million households by 2021.
8 million subscribers to mobile internet 
services by 2015 and 14 million subscribers 
by 2021.
50%  of  government  agencies  connected  to 
the  internet  at  25  Mbps  and  at  least  one 
public access point at 25 Mbps serving 50% 
of  localities  by  2015,  and  all  government 
agencies  connected  to  the  internet  at  25 
Mbps and one public access point serving all 
major centers and localities by 2021.

The  strategy  also  addresses  the  legislative 
environment required for the coming phase.
This involves the amendment of a number of 
existing laws: Telecommunications Law No. 10 
of 2003, for example, contains certain articles 
that  require  amendment  in  line  with  Egypt’s 
democratic transition that will promote political 
openness and protect freedom of expression. 
Additionally,  a  number  of  new  laws  and 
regulations  will  be  prepared,  drafted  and 
activated covering areas including freedom of 
information,  cyber  security  and  e-commerce.
There  are  also  plans  to  develop  labor  laws 
related  to  working  at  home  and  part-time 
and  temporary  employment  for  university 
students, which will increase the number of 
people working in outsourcing.

Strategy Drafting Methodology

The Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology was established in 1999 to develop 
the  national  ICT  sector.  Highlights  of  MCIT’s 
journey  so  far  include  the  release  of  the 
National  Communications  Plan  in  2000,  the 
Strategy  for  Building  the  Information  Society 
in 2003, the IT Industry National Development 
Strategy in 2006, and the National Strategy for 
Communications  and  Information  Technology 
in 2007.

The  National  ICT  Strategy  for  2012-2017  is 
another important stage of this process. Yet it 
is  also  significant  as  its  release  comes  at  the 
beginning of a new era for Egypt. As such, the 
strategy  was  formulated  for  implementation 
in  an  atmosphere  of  political  and  economic 
change,  to  support  the  country’s  transition 
while contributing to the development of the 
communications  sector  both  regionally  and 
internationally.  As  with  previous  strategies,  it 
focuses  on  integrating  ICTs  across  all  sectors 
to  serve  the  national  development  priorities, 
which include preserving natural resources and 
the environment.

Primary Considerations

In the formulation of this strategy, the primary 
considerations were the political and economic 
changes taking place in Egypt, the development 
of the communications sector both regionally and 
internationally, and Egypt’s national development 
priorities,  in  addition  to  the  achievements  and 
challenges of the sector over the last decade.

Work Methodology

following 

The  methodology  followed  in  the  drafting  of 
the strategy relied on participation and dialogue 
between MCIT and affiliated entities, in addition 
to  community  dialogue  with  government 
entities,  the  private  sector  and  civil  society 
organizations.  Work  began 
the 
formation  of  a  specialized  committee  by  the 
Minister  of  Communications  and  Information 
Technology  mandated  to  draft  the  strategy.
The  committee  included  representatives  from 
various  departments  of  MCIT  and  its  affiliated 
entities.  The  general  framework  and  main 
features  of  the  strategy  were  defined  and 
reviewed  in  cooperation  with  the  executive 
committee of the ministry. 

the  Cabinet. 

In  February  2012,  an  executive  summary 
of  the  strategy  was  introduced  before  the 
People’s  Assembly  and 
In 
addition,  dialogues  were  initiated  with  the 
wider  community,  including  meetings  with 
representatives  from  the  private  sector,  civil 
society  and  the  media.  As  ICT  impacts  on 
performance across all sectors of the economy, 
MCIT held a meeting with representatives from 
all government ministries to ensure their needs 
would be reflected within the new ICT strategy. 

12
13

This  meeting  included  a  review  of  efforts 
exerted over the previous 10 years, an overview 
of the features of the National ICT Strategy for 
2012-2017 and discussion of the future plans of 
the various ministries in this context.

In  March  2012,  a  detailed  presentation  on 
the  ICT  sector  was  held  for  the  Transport 
and  Information  Committee  of  the  People’s 
Assembly  highlighting  the  progress  of  the 
sector 
development 
strategies  since  2000  and  the  features  of  the 
new  strategy.  The  drafting  team  incorporated 
relevant  input  from  the  attendees  into  the 
current document.

successive 

through 

Strategy Framework

The present document is divided into two main 
parts:

The first part includes the vision, mission, aims 
and  policies  for  the  ICT  sector  from  2012  to 
2017, as well as the most important legislative 
amendments  that  will  be  formulated  during 
this period.

The  second  part  introduces  the  seven  main 
pillars of the strategy and their corresponding 
programs, and the six targeted initiatives to be 
implemented through the executive plan of the 
strategy. 

The  executive  plan  of  the  strategy,  including 
all  the  projects  to  be  implemented  through 
the  strategic  axes  and  targeted  initiatives,  is 
presented in a separate document.

The ICT revolution has extended the reach of the 
sector  far  beyond  facilitating  communication, 
to the extent that sustainable development in 
all fields now largely relies on the use of ICTs.

Egypt’s  25  January  Revolution,  which  in  early 
2011  set  the  country  on  the  path  of  political 
transformation, was itself largely influenced by 
the  use  of  ICTs,  in  particular  social  networks.
Aside from the major changes this revolution 
ushered in for Egypt, it has also changed the 
way Egyptians perceive ICT tools and systems, 
which have created an important platform for 
them  to  express  their  opinions,  participate  in 
public affairs and join together to find solutions 
to issues of common concern.

Since the revolution, not only has there been 
considerable growth in the number of Egyptians 
using  the  internet,  but  significant  changes 
in  the  way  the  internet  is  used,  with  one  of 
the more notable shifts being the increase in 
young  people  engaging  with  political  rather 
than entertainment-related content.

In  this  context,  three  main  features  of  the 
internet  are  clear:  its  interactive  nature;  the 
absence  of  a  central  organizational  authority, 
making content online more difficult to control 
and  monitor  than  traditional  media  content; 
and the broad social base of users, which is not 
limited by geographic or political boundaries.

As a result, those using the internet are not mere 
recipients of content but active participants in 
its formation. This has brought about a change  
in the very nature of communication: ordinary 
members of society are now able to respond 
and  interact.  Indeed,  online  dialogue  is  often 
peer-to-peer in nature, reflecting less the social 

position or political affiliation of interlocutors than 
their  opinions  on  certain  topics.  Some  argue 
that  the  influence  of  the  internet  within  society 
and  the  prevalence  of  networking  have  brought 
about a shift from hierarchical state to networking 
community.

MCIT seeks to embrace this shift, and to empower 
all Egyptians to play a full and active role as digital 
citizens  in  the  development  of  their  community 
and society.
1.1 The ICT Sector: Past and Present

The amazing development in ICT usage in Egypt 
would not have occurred without the technical 
and  institutional  boom  set  in  motion  by  the 
government since 2000. The newly established 
Ministry  of  Communications  and  Information 
Technology  set  out  to  establish  a  vibrant  and 
open ICT  sector, to ensure wide access to fast 
internet through a solid infrastructure capable 
of  attracting  investment  and  supporting  the 
development  of  both  the  sector  and  the 
wider  economy,  and  to  promote  the  training 
necessary to enable citizens to adapt ICT tools 
and systems to serve the community and boost 
the economic performance of the state.

In  2000,  MCIT  initiated  a  National  ICT  Plan  to 
ensure  the  spread  and  effective  use  of  ICT 
among  both  individuals  and  businesses,  and 
to  establish  legislative  and  regulatory  rules 
to guarantee an open market for ICT services. 
As  part  of  this  process,  MCIT  identified  best 
practices, critical success factors and potential 
challenges,  allowing  it  to  amend  ICT  policies 
and  restructure  the  sector  in  response  to      
real-time needs.

1 - Towards a Digital Society and Knowledge-based Economy

The  Egyptian  Information  Society  Initiative, 
introduced  in  2004,  achieved  tremendous 
progress in expanding and modernizing the ICT 
infrastructure. It also laid firm foundations for 
continuous  development  at  a  rate  at  which 
Egyptian  society  could  adapt,  reducing  the 
digital  divide  between  different  sectors  of 
society  by  providing  access  to  high-speed 
internet  and  ICT  tools  for  individuals  and 
institutions.  A  major  success  of  the  initiative 
was the establishment of an educational base 
offering  all  Egyptians  the  chance  to  adopt 
and use ICTs. The plan also focused on using 
ICTs  to  develop  and  improve  public  services, 
particularly  in  the  fields  of  healthcare  and 
education. The 2004 strategy focused on Public 
Private  Partnerships  and  on  fair  regulation  of 
the ICT market. 

Recognizing the essential role of ICT in social 
and economic development, MCIT devised the 
ICT  for  All  program  to  fulfill  two  main  goals: 
first, raising citizens’ quality of life by helping 
the  government 
improve  public  service 
provision  through  the  use  of  ICTs  and  the 
development  of  a  knowledge-based  society; 
and  second,  facilitating  citizens’  access  to 
computers  and  high-speed  internet,  raising 
youth  employability  through 
ICT  training, 
thus,  encouraging  government  employees 
to  undertake  internationally  accredited  ICT 
certification programs.

Egypt’s  ICT  Strategy  of  2007  was  formulated 
to  build  on  the  progress  achieved  by  the 
government  in  partnership  with  the  private 
sector and civil society. 

It  focused  on  establishing  local,  regional  and 
global  partnerships  attracting 
investment 
through  a  range  of 
incentives,  and  the 
establishment  of  technology  parks  such  as 
Smart Village and Contact Center Park in Maadi.

A  major  component  of  the  strategy  was  the 
promotion of exports in ICT outsourcing services. 
Strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, 
Africa and the Middle East, and enjoying and a 
large pool of young, multilingual and technically 
proficient human resources, Egypt has quickly 
developed  a  strong  outsourcing  industry  and 
positioned itself as a world leader in the field.

The successful growth of Egypt’s ICT sector is 
clear in the following indicators:

During the period 2008/09-2010/11, the ICT 
sector raised an annual average of LE 33.71 
billion in revenues, with an average annual 
growth  rate  of  11.63%,  and  contributed 
about 4% of GDP
The  ICT  sector  recorded  a  growth  rate  of 
3.71% in the last quarter of 2011
Between 2006 and 2011, the ICT sector 
contributed with LE 82.28 billion to the treasury.
Egyptian exports of cross-border outsourcing 
services via the internet were worth $1.487 
billion  a  year  by  the  end  of  2011.  Egypt, 
represented  by  the  Information  Technology 
Industry  Development  Agency  (ITIDA),  was 
named Offshoring Destination of the Year in 
2008 by the National Outsourcing Association, 
received  a  European  Outsourcing  Award  in 

18
19

2009  and  was  ranked  fourth  in  the  2011 
Global  Services  Localization  Index  published 
by A.T. Kearney
At  the  end  of  2011,  the  number  of  mobile 
phone subscriptions was about 83.4 million, 
representing  a  penetration  rate  of  about 
102.76%
At the end of 2011, the number of internet 
users in Egypt was about 29 million with an 
annual growth rate of 26%
At  the  end  of  2011,  the  number  of  fixed-
line subscribers reached 8.71 million, with a 
penetration rate of 10.91%
The  Smart  Village  technology  park  has 
attracted  investments  amounting  to  LE  6 
billion and created 40,000 job opportunities 
followed  by  Cairo  Contact  Center  Park  in 
Maadi
42,000 direct job opportunities and 120,000 
indirect job opportunities were created in the 
last three years through outsourcing and the 
export of technology services

Despite  the  difficult  circumstances  of  the 
transition period ushered in by the revolution 
of January 2011, which has had a major impact 
on  the  Egyptian  economy,  the  ICT  sector  has 
continued to flourish, with its growth rate rising 
to 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

The  sector  has  also  continued  to  create  jobs, 
with a 41% rise in the number of employees 
of international ICT companies in the Egyptian 
market in 2011 over the previous year and an 
18% rise in those employed by local companies. 
In  addition,  and  according  to  the  Ministry  of 
Planning, primary indicators for the third quarter 
of  the  fiscal  year  2011/12  show  that  the  ICT 
sector recorded an increase in real growth rates 
from 2.8% in the third quarter of 2010/11 to 
8.9% in the third quarter of 2011/12.
In  November  2011,  a 
issued  by 
Oxford  Business  Group  noted  the  significant 
investments in the Egyptian ICT sector despite 
the disturbances following the revolution, and 
that the sector is expected to recover to levels 
seen  prior  to  the  revolution  and  the  global 
financial crisis. In 2008/09, the sector attracted 
investment of LE 14 billion.

3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets

22
23

3.1  Strategic Objectives

The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 aims 
to enable the ICT sector with all its resources to 
help achieve the objectives of the 25 January 
Revolution  –  freedom,  democracy  and  social 
justice – supported by an open and competitive 
market. It also aims at raising the attractiveness 
of  the  Egyptian  economy  to  investment, 
increasing  revenues  for  the  government  and 
the private sector, and facilitating the necessary 
restructuring  of  the  sector  in  line  with  global 
innovation in the field. The strategy targets not 
only building a strong national industry capable 
of raising exports and creating job opportunities 
for youth, but also helping to improve the level 
and quality of public services.

The realization of this vision requires a process 
of  cumulative  building  on  achievements  in 
,
support  of  Egypt
s  continued  development  in 
the realm of ICT, with work on various strategic 
axes in line with the government objective of 
positioning Egypt as one of the most prominent 
knowledge-based economies.

In this context, Egypt’s strategic ICT objectives are 
characterized  by  applicability  and  quantitative 
measurability,  allowing  for  easy  monitoring  of 
progress.

The  four  main  strategic  objectives  of  the 
strategy are:

Supporting the democratic transition

Promoting digital citizenship and information 
society

Promoting sustainable development

Strengthening the national economy

First: Supporting the democratic transition

1- Building a knowledge-based society with 
universal access to information resources

This  is  served  by  the  National  Broadband 
Strategy to expand the geographic coverage of 
infrastructure providing high-speed internet and 
to increase internet penetration, particularly in 
marginalized  and  under  privileged  areas.  The 
strategy aims to raise the number of subscribers 
to high-speed internet to 13 million by 2015, 
through  the  expansion  of  the  broadband 
network,  especially  last  mile  links  and  fiber-
optic  cables  for  telephone  exchanges.  The 
strategy  also  seeks  to  raise  the  proportion  of 
Egyptian households using personal computers 
to 40%, to provide a national network of 1,000 
Technology  Homes  and  2,000  IT  Clubs,  to 
connect all schools and educational institutions 
to high-speed internet, to expand e-commerce 
by  20%,  to  increase  the  number  of  secured 
Egyptian  websites  by  810%  to  increase  the 
proportion  of  banking  customers  using  online 
or  mobile  banking  to  30%,  and  to  increase 
use of e-signature applications by government 
bodies.

2- Digital identity management

A large number of digital identity management 
solutions have been developed in recent years 
as  part  of  efforts  to  build  public  confidence  in 
online  transactions  and  encourage  the  use  of 
electronic services. These ongoing efforts involve 
developing  suitable  technological  tools  and 
systems; promoting greater use of e-commerce, 
e-health  and  e-government  services;  and 
developing  cyber  security  systems  to  prevent 
identity theft and protect user privacy.

3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets

3-  Maintaining  a  legislative  environment 
conducive to ICT sector growth and investment

2- Internet-related issues, information exchange 
and access, and freedom of expression

The  strategy  involves  the  amendment  of  a    
number of existing laws. The Telecommunications 
Law  No.  10  of  2003,  for  example,  contains 
certain  articles  that  require  amendment  in 
line  with  Egypt’s  democratic  transition  that 
will  promote  political  openness  and  protect 
freedom of expression. Additionally, a number 
of new laws and regulations will be prepared, 
drafted and activated covering areas including 
freedom  of  information,  cybersecurity  and 
e-commerce. There are also plans to develop 
labor laws related to working at home and part-
time and temporary employment for university 
students,  which  will  increase  the  number  of 
people working in outsourcing.

Second:  Promoting  digital  citizenship  and 
information society

1-  Using 
ICTs  to  empower  the  elderly 
and  people  with  disabilities,  and  serve 
marginalized and remote communities

This  will  be  achieved  through  developing 
mail  services,  introducing  new  services  that 
contribute  to  solving  community  problems, 
raising  the  proportion  of  households  with 
personal  computers  to  40%,  and  providing  a 
national network of 1,000 Technology Homes 
and 2,000 IT Clubs. These services give priority 
to  people  with  disabilities,  including  those 
who  sustained  serious  injuries  during  the  25 
January  Revolution.  Programs  have  also  been 
established  to  raise  the  ICT  skill  levels  of 
women, particularly those who act as the sole 
breadwinners of their households.

The  strategy  focuses  on  various  internet-related 
issues, including the right of citizens to unrestricted 
communication,  an  open  internet,  strong  social 
networks, internet privacy, public radio frequencies, 
public websites, public digital services, freedom of 
movement and association in cyberspace, freedom 
of expression, unrestricted access to information, 
the right of education and access to information 
technology that could be used indiscriminately and 
protection of intellectual property.

3- Developing people’s ability to communicate 
and connect with their environment

This  will  be  achieved  using 
information 
and  communication  cables  and  networks 
to  guarantee  citizens  their  right  to  personal 
communication and participation, open access 
to  means  of  communication  and  unrestricted 
access to information.

4- Developing network security systems

The strategy includes development of network 
security systems, to support the banking sector 
and online payment systems in particular. The 
increased use of online payment systems will 
promote development of the banking system 
and raise its efficiency.

5- Online safety and privacy

Successful promotion of online safety requires 
cooperation  between  concerned  government 
authorities, the private sector and civil society 
focusing  on  raising  public  awareness  and 
empowerment. The aim is to enable people to 
protect  themselves  and  their  children  online, 
particularly on social networks, and in their use 
of mobile phones.

24
25

Third: Promoting sustainable development
1-  Improving  basic  services  in  the  fields  of 
education,  healthcare,  environment    and 
ensuring  the  delivery  of  subsidy  to  people 
who deserve it

largely  on 

The  success  of  initiatives  targeting  integrated 
development  depends 
the 
availability of easy-to-access high-quality basic 
services and the readiness of local communities 
to evaluate and guarantee the quality of these 
services.  In  this  context,  the  following  three 
basic targets have been identified:

Poverty  reduction  and  the  raising  of  living 
standards  in  identified  local  communities 
through  empowerment,  facilitating  market 
access,  improving  education  and  training 
services, and developing basic infrastructure 
networks

,

Ensuring local communities
 ownership of the 
services received through their involvement 
in evaluating the quality of these services

Building a relationship of trust between the 
government and local communities. Indeed, 
the  improvement  of  the  quality  and  scope 
of  basic  services  reflects  the  government’s 
commitment to respect, meet and safeguard 
citizens
 rights and to save natural resources 
in the interest of future  generations

,

In  support  of  these  objectives,  the  strategy 
aims  to  support  and  develop  the  key  sectors 
of  education  and  healthcare  through  the  use 
of  ICTs.  In  education,  this  includes  the  use 
of  computers  and  high-speed  internet  in 
educational  institutions  across  the  country 
and  the  development  of  ICT-based  education 
programs  and  materials,  especially 
for 
university  students.  This  will  allow  Egyptian 
graduates to compete in the global market and 

enable Egypt to produce and develop ICT tools 
and software to international standards.

In healthcare, the strategy targets improvement 
of  services,  particularly  for  marginalized  and 
remote  communities,  as  well  as  improving 
support  systems,  enhancing  management 
and  use  of  state  resources,  and  reducing 
expenditure. In this context, the development 
of  ICT  infrastructure  for  government  bodies 
that  supports  digital  identity  systems  will 
provide citizens with more secure, better and 
faster services and support the transition to a 
knowledge-based society.

The  strategy  also  aims  to  promote  the 
development  of  mobile  services,  expansion 
of  mobile  coverage  in  underserved  areas, 
adherence to global standards in environmental 
to  mobile 
and  health  protection  related 
stations,  development  of  mobile 
internet 
access  services,  use  of  geo  data  bases  and 
similar systems, and use of ICTs to monitor and 
facilitate adaptation to climate change.

2-  Using  ICTs  to  develop  legislative,  judicial 
and executive institutions

improving 

The integration of ICTs will raise the efficiency of 
state institutions, developing their performance, 
increasing  productivity, 
response 
time,  facilitating  community  participation  and 
boosting  transparency.  These  efforts  include 
measures  to  promote  the  use  of  e-signature 
applications by government institutions and to 
,
develop  key  sectors  through  ICTs
  integration, 
including industry, commerce, transport, justice 
and  tourism.  Development  of  the  legislative 
structure is essential to maintain an environment 
conducive to the further spread of ICT use.

3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets

technology innovation and entrepreneurship

5- Strengthening Egypt’s role as a 
communications hub

8-  Enhancing  Egypt’s  position  in  ICT  in  the 
regional and international arenas

This  can  be  achieved  through  realization  of 
growth  rates  of  710%  for  the  sector  for  the 
next five years, a 20% increase in investment 
to LE 55 billion, IT service outsourcing exports 
of $2.5 billion, intellectual property revenues 
of  $1  billion,  the  growth  of  Egypt  Post  as  a 
primary savings facility by an annual average 
of about 15%, and the development of a strong 
Egyptian  ICT  industry  that  excels  in  software 
development  and  component  manufacturing 
and assembly.

2- Enhancing Egypt’s position as a leading 
global outsourcing destination

Efforts to enhance Egypt’s position as a global 
leader in outsourcing aim at increasing annual 
export  revenues  from  IT  service  outsourcing 
to  $2.5  billion  and  intellectual  property  to 
$1  billion.  Measures  to  achieve  these  goals 
include:  establishing  a  national  network  of 
20 technology parks; diversification of target 
markets  for  Egyptian  outsourcing  exports; 
promoting  greater  participation  from  small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs) in IT service 
outsourcing; 
the  number  of 
outsourcing  professionals,  with  the  aim  of 
creating  75,000  direct  job  opportunities  and 
220,000 indirect job opportunities by the end 
of  2017;  attracting  more  foreign  investment 
through  global  promotional  campaigns;  and 
maintaining  a  strong  Egyptian  presence  in 
regional and international fairs, trade missions 
and  efforts  to  protect  intellectual  property 
rights and personal data.

increasing 

Efforts to create an environment conducive 
to innovation and entrepreneurship include 
promoting the use of innovative technologies 
to solve development challenges, attracting 
more  foreign  investment  in  innovation 
and  entrepreneurship,  and  supporting  the 
establishment  of  local  companies  capable 
of innovation. The strategy, which aims at 
creating 10,000 job opportunities in the field 
of  innovation,  will  boost  and  accelerate 
development and help position Egypt as a 
regional innovation center.

4- Supporting the digital content industry

The  strategy  seeks  to  develop  Egypt’s  digital 
content  industry  to  promote  and  preserve 
Egypt’s  culture  and  heritage,  and  the  wider 
Arab  identity,  and  to  maintain  Egypt’s  position 
as  a  regional  leader  in  this  field.  The  industry 
will  provide  important  opportunities  for  the 
creation of both employment and exports, while 
enriching Arabic content on the internet.

The strategy aims to increase the competitiveness 
of  the  Egyptian  digital  content  industry  by 
encouraging  the  private  sector  to  produce 
and  develop  Arabic  digital  content;  promoting 
development of the skills required by the digital 
content  industry;  and  supporting  universities, 
research  centers,  centers  of  excellence  and 
companies in developing research and tools to 
enhance digital content, particularly for mobile 
applications.

26
27

The strategy aims to strengthen Egypt’s role as a 
hub for communication cables and transit traffic 
by building on the country’s various competitive 
advantages  in  the  field,  which  include  its 
location at the meeting point of Europe, Africa 
and the Middle East, and a large pool of young, 
multilingual  and  technically  proficient  human 
resources.

6-  Raising  the  competitiveness  of  Egyptian 
youth in ICT

This will be achieved through various initiatives 
that  aim  at  providing  vocational  training  for 
young  people  and  equipping  them  with  the 
skills required by the ICT sector, especially in the 
fields of outsourcing and technology innovation. 
These  initiatives  include  the  establishment 
of  Technology  Homes  as  the  first  stage  in  the 
creation  of  the  Technology  Corridor  of  Egypt 
–  a  virtual  corridor  that  will  extend  across  all 
governorates. Such efforts promote the role of 
young people in development and attract them 
to the ICT sector.

7- Supporting and developing MSMEs working 
in ICT

Efforts to develop the role of micro, small and 
medium enterprises in the field of ICT are focused 
on 
increasing  companies’  competitiveness, 
opening  new  markets  and  opportunities  for 
production,  and  improving  the  performance  of 
small  and  micro  enterprises  outside  of  Egypt’s 
main cities in order to contribute in creating job 
opportunities and reducing unemployment.

MCIT, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs,  aims  at  raising  Egypt’s  performance  in 
regional and international ICT indicators. Efforts 
in this regard include strengthening cooperation 
between Egypt and the international community 
in  the  field  of  ICT,  with  priority  given  to 
cooperation with the Nile Basin countries through 
a technical support program and joint ventures 
targeting  the  establishment  of  a  knowledge-
based society in the region. MCIT also seeks to 
expand efforts in human capacity building with 
both the Nile Basin and Arab countries through 
,
specialized  training  programs,  to  boost  Egypt
s 
role in international dialogue on ICT and related 
issues,  and  to  expand  partnerships  between 
Egypt  and  countries  around  the  world.  These 
efforts will enable Egypt to attract more foreign 
investment, 
ICT  sector 
growth and creating employment opportunities 
for young people.

4 - Developing Relevant Legislation

30
31

There  is  no  doubt  that  a  supportive  legislative 
environment  for  the  ICT  sector  is  fundamental 
to its success and its ability to attract local and 
foreign investment.

Egypt  has  issued  various  laws  relating  to  the 
ICT sector over the last 10 years, covering areas 
including  regulation  of  telecommunications, 
e-signatures  and  protection  of 
intellectual 
property.  However,  due  to  the  growth  of  the 
sector,  as  well  as  the  fast  pace  of  change  in 
ICT, new or amended legislation is required to 
ensure  that  the  rights  of  investors,  employees 
and  the  public  are  fully  protected  by  the  law. 
Furthermore,  since  the  ICT  sector  has  since  its 
inception been a pillar of the national economy, it 
is important in light of Egypt’s current democratic 
transition to maintain a legislative environment 
that  boosts  the  sector’s  ability  to  grow  and  to 
support other sectors of the economy.

In  the  final  quarter  of  2011,  MCIT  formed  a 
committee  of  legal  and  technical  experts  to 
formulate  a  set  of  new  regulations  for  the 
coming  phase,  and  to  propose  modifications, 
where appropriate, to existing regulations.

Telecommunications  Law  No.  10  of  2003  has 
since  been  amended,  and  the  committee  is 
soon  to  present  its  proposed  amendments  to 
E-Signature Law No. 15 of 2004. The committee 
has  also  begun  work  to  formulate  draft  laws 
relating to freedom of information, cybersecurity 
and e-commerce.

When drafting bills, the committee first examines 
relevant  legislation  from  other  countries  and 
reviews reports and opinions from civil society 
organizations  and  specialists.  Committee 
members then discuss and formulate the draft 
law,  which  passes  through  several  rounds  of 
review before presentation to parliament.

4.1 Telecommunications Law No. 10 of 2003

Telecommunications  Law  No.  10  of  2003  was 
one of the laws most in need of amendment due 
to its political dimensions. During the 25 January 
Revolution, the governing authorities found legal 
justification in Articles 65 and 67 of this law to 
disconnect  various  means  of  communication, 
even though this action restricted the basic right 
of freedom of expression.

After the revolution, MCIT, in response to public 
demand, 
initiated  a  community  dialogue 
concerning  necessary  amendments  to  the 
law.  The  ministry  then  formed  a  committee 
charged  with  reviewing  existing  legislation 
and  drafting  new  laws,  in  consultation  with 
experts and representatives from the ICT sector 
and  concerned  civil  society  organizations  and 
taking  into  consideration  the  views  raised 
through  the  community  dialogue  also  opened 
a  dialogue  and  discussion  with  the  National 
Telecommunications  Regulatory  Authority  on 
this law.

The  committee  proposed  the  amendment  of 
about 55 articles, divided into five groups, and 
the addition of articles, as follows:

Group 1:

Amendments  to  definitions  applied  in  the 
law  and  items  concerning  the  formation  of 
the  National  Telecommunication  Regulatory 
Authority board of directors

Article  1:  Definitions  (telecommunications, 
broadcasting,  national  security  and  state 
media)
Article 12: Formation and membership of the 
NTRA board of directors

4 - Developing Relevant Legislation

Article 13: Work of the NTRA board of directors, 
licensing  rules  pertaining  to  infrastructure 
establishment,  and  regulations  relating  to 
penalties
Article  15:  Term  of  office  of  the  executive 
president of the NTRA
Article 25: Licensing obligations

Group 2:
Amendments to items concerning regulation of 
the  relationship  between  telecommunications 
companies

Article 28: Linkage between companies
Articles  33  and  34:  Implementation  of  the 
resolution until a final ruling is passed
Article  40:  Regulation  of  the  relationship 
between the licensee and the holder of the 
usufruct
Group 3:
Amendments to items concerning technological 
progress

Article 54 : Spectrum division after the switchover 
from analog to digital
Article 64 : Addition of technologies and software 
to equipment used for encryption

Group 4:
Amendments to items concerning the authority 
to disconnect communications
The  most  important  amendments  to  the  law 
involved Articles 65 and 67, which stipulated that in 
the case of general mobilization the prime minister 
should determine the competent state authority to 
manage all telecommunications services, networks, 
operators and service providers. The conditions for 
such  a  general  mobilization  included  natural  and 
environmental disasters and national security threats.

32

Article 65, original:

Article 67, original:

The  National  Telecommunication  Regulatory 
Authority shall, in cooperation with the Armed 
Forces and the concerned state entities, prepare a 
prior plan for the operation of telecommunications 
networks, to be implemented during natural or 
environmental disasters and periods of general 
mobilization according to the provisions of Law 
No. 87 of 1960 concerning general mobilization 
and any other circumstances related to national 
security. The plan shall be updated periodically 
in order to secure national defense and security. 
Telecommunications  operators  and  service 
providers  shall  be  obliged  to  implement  the 
plan.

Article 65, amended:

in  cooperation  with 

The  National  Telecommunication  Regulatory 
Authority  shall, 
the 
Ministry  of  Defense  and  the  concerned  state 
entities,  prepare  a  detailed  prior  plan  for  the 
operation  of  telecommunications  networks, 
to  be  implemented  during  periods  of  general 
mobilization, according to the provisions of Law 
No. 87 of 1960 concerning general mobilization, 
that shall be limited to tension in international 
relations, the threat of war, actual war, natural 
or environmental disasters, or crises threatening 
national  security.  The  plan  shall  include  the 
determination  of  the  authority  to  which  some 
or  all  telecommunications  services,  networks, 
operators and service providers, as well as those 
working  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of 
these  services  and  networks,  are  subject. 
The  plan  shall  be  updated  periodically  in 
order  to  secure  national  defense  and  security. 
Telecommunications  operators  and 
service 
providers shall be obliged to implement the plan.

The competent state authorities shall have the 
power  to  subject  to  their  administration  the 
telecommunications  services  and  networks 
of  any  operator  or  service  provider,  and  those 
working  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of 
these services and networks, in case of natural 
or  environmental  disaster  or  during  periods  of 
declared  general  mobilization  in  accordance 
with  the  provisions  of  Law  No.  87  of  1960 
concerning  these  and  other  cases  related  to 
national security.

Article 67, amended:

In  the  case  of  a  declaration  of  general 
mobilization  as  provided  for  in  Article  65,  the 
Cabinet  shall  issue  a  resolution  activating  the 
plan  referred  to  in  Article  65.  The  resolution 
shall define when implementation of the plan 
is to begin and the duration of its application.

In all cases, it shall be prohibited to disconnect 
telecommunications  services  or  to  stop  their 
operation entirely or partially, except in the case 
that a written decision has been issued by the 
President of the Republic following a proposal to 
do so by the Cabinet. In this case, the President 
of the Republic shall, within 15 days of issuing 
such  a  decision,  submit  a  detailed  report  to 
the  People’s  Assembly  explaining  the  reasons 
for adoption of the measure. In the event that 
the  People’s  Assembly  is  not  in  session,  the 
submission  shall  be  made  in  the  first  session 
held. In all cases, it shall not be permissible to 
disrupt or stop relief and emergency services.

Group 5:

Amendments  to  items  concerning  penalties  for 
crimes including disclosure of information, jamming 

of communications, use of encrypted devices and 
provision of telecommunications services without 
license in Articles 72, 76, 79, 81, 82, 84, 85 and 
87.

Group 6:

Addition of articles: Article 27-bis, concerning the 
share of Egyptian ownership in telecommunications 
companies;  and  Articles  63-bis  and  63-bis  (a), 
concerning state media and content licenses.

4.2 Freedom of Information Draft Law 
In light of the wide information space in which we 
live today, and in support of Egypt’s democratic 
transition,  the  Freedom  of  Information  Law 
will  fulfill  certain  important  aspirations  of  the 
Egyptian  people,  enshrining  in  law  their  right 
to access data and information, and serving to 
stabilize democratic practice.
This freedom, along with many others prevalent 
in democratic practice, provides an indication of 
political maturity, as with it comes responsibility. 
For this reason, the new law relies on specific 
measures  and  mechanisms  to  maintain  the 
right  balance  between  freedom  of  access  to 
information  and  preventing  misuse  of  this 
freedom. The basis of this law, therefore, is that 
access to information is the norm, and prevention 
the  exception,  but  in  a  manner  that  does  not 
infringe on the right to personal privacy or pose 
a  risk  to  national  security.  The  talk  about  the 
availability  of  information  could  harm  national 
security  of  Egypt  or  the  exposure  of  relations 
with other countries at risk under the banner of 
freedom  is  not  acceptable,  so  this  law  sought 
to bring about the desired balance between the 
considerations  of  freedom  as  a  fundamental 
human  rights  and  privacy  considerations  and 
national security.

4 - Developing Relevant Legislation

Around the world there are about 85 countries 
with  legislation  in  this  field  and  two  main 
approaches. The European approach is based on 
the formation of specialized entities to uphold 
the law and to review complaints and disputes, 
while the American approach favors the settling 
of disputes by the judiciary.

The Laws and Regulations Committee, favoring 
the adoption of the European approach, formed 
the  Supreme  Council  for  Data  and  Information 
to proceed with the drafting of the Freedom of 
Information Law. 

This law covers regulation of access to data and 
information;  the  measures  to  be  taken  when 
access is withdrawn to information that should 
be  readily  available  or  if  this  information  is 
manipulated; protection of information with the 
potential to affect national and public security; 
and  protection  of  personal  information  and 
criminalization of its use for purposes other than 
that for which it was provided.

The  law  prohibits  disclosure  of  data  and 
information  that  may  result  in:  harming  the 
interests of the country; betrayal of trust; direst 
damage  to  the  economic  interests  of  others; 
endangering  relations  with  a  foreign  country 
or  a  regional  or  international  organization;  or 
facilitating  crime  or  obstructing  its  discovery. 
It  also  protects  against  failure  to  disclose 
information that should be in the public sphere; 
intentional destruction of data and information 
records  and  registries;  disclosure  of  falsified, 
incorrect or deficient data and information; and 
disclosure  of  private  information  belonging  to 
others.
The Supreme Council for Data and Information is 
mandated to regulate the disclosure, circulation 
and  correction  of  data  and  information.  This 

council  is  granted  immunity  similar  to  that  of 
judicial authorities, and its decisions are binding 
unless  superseded  by  a  decision  from  the 
Administrative Court.

The duties of the council include establishing the 
necessary  security  classifications  for  data  and 
information;  monitoring  provision  of  data  and 
information;  promoting  a  culture  of  disclosure 
of  information;  and  cooperating  with  national, 
regional and international authorities concerned 
with freedom of information.

The council includes seven experienced full-time 
members  chosen  by  the  Shoura  Council  from 
nominations  provided  by  the  prime  minister, 
the  first  deputy  of  the  head  of  the  Cassation 
Court, the first deputy of the head of the State 
Council, and one representative from each of the 
Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior and 
the General Intelligence Agency. These full-time 
members  cannot  be  employees  of  the  state’s 
administrative system and are prohibited from 
engaging in politics.

Outcome:

A  comprehensive  law  was  drafted  in  seven 
chapters, containing 50 articles. It represents the 
biggest  response  possible  to  the  requirements 
of civil society, taking into consideration national 
security dimensions, and corresponding with the 
most recent legislation of its kind in the world.

4.3 Cybersecurity Draft Law
The three main axes of the Cybersecurity Draft 
Law relate to:

Protecting  cyberspace  and  its  contents  from 
any external violation

towards  protecting 
Agencies’  obligations 
their  information  space,  and  the  data  and 

34
35

information 
personal information

included 

therein,  particularly 

Creating  a  national  authority  responsible  for 
monitoring  all  cybersecurity  activities  and 
issuing licenses to operate within this domain

The  law  defines  the  obligations  of  those 
controlling data and information and establishes 
rules  to  ensure  they  secure  their  information 
space as well as the data, systems, programs and 
networks contained therein. It also establishes a 
system to manage the operation of information 
resources,  and  means  of  securing  information 
operation  sites  and  accessing  information  and 
networks. Additionally, the law aims to combat 
crime  related  to  information  systems  and 
networks  in  order  to  help  maintain  national 
security, preserve the rights of legitimate users 
of  computers  and  information  networks,  and 
protect the public interest.

The  draft  law  includes  definitions  of  various 
terms contained therein, including both tools of 
operation and forms of criminal activity, such as 
piracy, hacking, malware and infiltration.

The  law  establishes  the  National  Authority  for 
Information  Security,  whose  authorities  and 
powers  include  establishing  an  information 
security  strategy,  promoting  a  culture  of 
registration  and 
information  security,  and 
licensing  of 
information 
security 
service 
providers.  Also  define  obligations  on  the 
controller  of  information,  and  to  develop  a 
system to manage the operation of IT resources, 
and  how  to  secure  sites  and  how  to  access 
information  and  networks,  also  singled  out  a 
special  chapter  for  experts,  and  stressed  may 
not engage in any act of experience in the field 
of  information  security  only  after  enrollment 
in the register national experts at the national 
authority for information security.

 

regarding 

The law stiffens penalties for those committing 
information  crimes,  with  imprisonment  for 
not  less  than  six  months  and/or  a  fine  of 
between  LE  20,000  and  LE  50,000.  It  also 
doubles the minimum and maximum penalties 
in  certain  situations,  such  as 
for  crimes 
committed  with  intent  to  damage  the  public 
interest  or  an  individual  public  authority,  or 
the  creation,  duplication  or  possession  with 
the  aim  of  distribution,  publication  or  sale  of 
materials  violating  public  decency,  particularly 
if  they  involve  children.  It  also  provides  for 
imprisonment and fining in case of re-offense.
In preparing and formulating the draft law, the 
Laws  and  Regulations  Committee  relied  on 
various  reference  materials.  These  included: 
International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU) 
recommendations 
cybersecurity; 
relevant Indian law; the Legislation Management 
Draft Law of the Ministry of Justice; the Decision 
Support  Center  Draft  Law;  the  Convention  on 
Cybercrime (Budapest Agreement) of the Council 
of  Europe;  and  “Cybercrime,”  by  information 
security expert Ahmed El-Sobky.
Outcome:
A  comprehensive  law  was  drafted  containing 
over  70  articles.  It  represents  the  biggest 
response  possible  to  the  requirements  of  civil 
society,  taking  into  consideration  the  national 
security dimension, and corresponding with the 
most recent legislation of its kind in the world.
4.4 E-Commerce Draft Law
The Laws and Regulations Committee will, during 
the coming period, work on the preparation and 
drafting of the E-Commerce Draft Law.
4.5 E-Signature Draft Law
The Laws and Regulations Committee will, during 
the coming period, work on the preparation and 
drafting of amendments to E-Signature Law No. 
15 of 2004.

5 - General and Targeted Strategic Policies

In light of the rapid and ongoing growth of the 
ICT sector, developing policies and regulations 
related  to  modern  technologies  is  a  strategic 
national priority. The importance of determining 
and adopting the right policies stems from the 
need to establish the foundations, mechanisms 
and procedures through which strategies can be 
successfully implemented, with close attention 
to  protecting  the  interests  of  individuals  and 
society,  and  identifying  users’  duties  and 
responsibilities.

The policies adopted in previous strategic plans 
were  successful  in  ensuring  the  ICT  sector’s 
ability  to  meet  increasing  demand.  From 
October 2010 to October 2011, the number of 
internet users increased by 20.36% from 23.06 
million to 27.75 million, while the number of 
mobile internet subscribers grew by 15.7%.

MCIT 
therefore  established  various  work 
programs to develop and determine policies in 
light  of  strategic  planning  aims,  research  and 
analytical studies. These programs aim at: 

Drafting  and  updating  policies  and  guiding 
principles  concerning 
local 
development

ICT  use 

in 

36
37

Contributing to the development of legislative 
and regulatory frameworks related to the ICT 
sector

Supporting  the  development  of  strategies 
to  increase  the  spread  and  use  of  ICTs  and 
maximize their benefit to users and society

Monitoring developments in technology

The National ICT Strategy for 2012 - 2017 was 
formulated  with  special  attention  to  the 
following considerations:

Drafting policies with the greatest flexibility 
to  respond  to  the  increasing  demand  for 
communications services through continuous 
development of ICT infrastructure. This can be 
facilitated by market studies determining the 
priority needs of consumers and the business 
sector and at the same time be aware of the 
challenges  faced  by  the  consuming  sectors 
for this kind of service

Drafting  the  most  comprehensive  policies 
possible, enabling Egypt to excel in using ICTs 
for  development.  This  can  be  achieved  by 
providing  ICT  infrastructure  in  marginalized 
areas,  encouraging  inter-company  use  of 
ICTs, increasing ICT access for Arabic speakers, 
and  providing  support  for  SMEs,  which  can 
play an important role in ICT service exports 
and the production of Arabic digital content

Drafting  policies 
that  have  quantifiable 
objectives  and  whose  progress  is  easy  to 
monitor

MCIT  will  review  the  policies  of  the  strategy 
and make modifications as and when required, 
in  accordance  with  government  policies  and 
priorities, in response to relevant developments 
in the ICT field.

The  policies  contained  in  the  strategy  are 
divided into two types, as follows: 

General Policies:

These policies apply to all projects and programs 
for the ICT sector due to their importance both 
to Egypt and the international community. They 
relate  to  issues  that  have  a  clear  and  direct 
impact on the success and effectiveness of ICT 
sector activities. These policies cover:

Digital identity management

Green ICT

Empowerment of people with disabilities

Access to information

Mobile applications for development

Targeted Policies:

These  policies  apply  to  a  limited  number  of 
programs in certain fields. They relate to areas 
of  particular  importance  at  the  current  time 
that will also help boost future development of 
the ICT sector. These policies cover:

Arabic digital content

Cloud computing

e-Commerce

Manufacturing of tablet computers

Open-source software

6 - Strategic Pillars and Executive Work Programs

The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 comprises 

 6.1 Telecommunications and Postal Service Infrastructure

seven main work pillars that represent the executive 

tracks for programs and projects related to the ICT 

sector  in  the  next  five  years.  These  pillars  reflect

The  targeted  initiatives  of  the  National  ICT 
Strategy for 2012-2017 aim to enhance Egypt’s 
global position in the field of ICT globally and 
to  increase  the  contribution  of  the  sector 
to  the  GDP.  There  is  a  general  agreement 
among  the  ICT  community  that  the  targeted 
initiatives  identified  below  have  a  priority  in 
implementation and address specific challenges 
and needs that are high on the national agenda.  
The initiatives will also play an important role 
in  empowering  the  Egyptian  society  and  in 
contributing  to  the  sustainable  development 
goals by offering higher quality series at lower 
cost to the Egyptian citizen.  

The targeted strategic initiatives include:

Digital Identity Management Initiative

Arabic Digital Content Initiative

Educational Reform Initiative using ICTs, Cloud 
Computing and the Tablet Computer

Back to Africa Initiative

ICT  for  Empowering  People  with  Disabilities 
Initiative (PWDs)

Green ICT Initiative

In addition, the Broadband Initiative was launched 
in  September  2011  and  is  considered  a  key 
milestone in the ICT sector plan. The initiative 
aims  at  promoting  the  high-speed  Internet 
industry  in  Egypt  with  its  three  elements: 
networks,  services  and  users,  establishing 
the  leading position of Egypt in the region in 
this  field  in  light  of  the  changes  experienced 
by  the  country  and  the  massive  demand  on 

the internet speed and the quality of services 
provided, in addition to the increased desire of 
users  for  accessing  the  visual  content,  news 
and multimedia services. The national plan of 
the Broadband Initiative (eMisr) was launched 
and comprises two phases:

The objectives of the initiative are summarized 
as follows:

Egypt to reach a leading position in the digital 
communication field 

Stimulating  economic  growth  nationwide 
and enhancing social cohesion 

Increasing job opportunities 

Coordinating with other Egyptian government 
sectors and improving the standard of living 
and the quality of life for all citizens 

Bridging the digital gap in Egypt  

These  objectives  were  identified  for  their 
relevance  to  the  current  priorities  of  Egypt 
and  the  major  world  economies.  Egypt’s 
previous national ICT strategies supported the 
establishment  of  solid  telecommunications 
infrastructure,  development  of  a  vibrant  ICT 
sector,  growth  in  access  to  and  use  of  ICTs, 
empowerment and capacity building. Looking 
forward,  the  current  strategy,  while  building 
on and developing these efforts, also aims to 
unlock the latent potential of ICTs to promote 
and  support  advancement  not  only  for  the 
sector, but for the wider economy and society 
as a whole. 

7 - Targeted Strategic Initiatives

7.1 Digital Identity Management Initiative

Digital  identity  management  has  become  of 
great  importance  in  the  internet  economy. 
In  the  mid-nineties,  the  ability  to  access 
information  via  internet  was  considered  a 
revolutionary  transition.    Very  quickly,  the 
internet  changed  from  a  one  side  posting 
tool to a two way platform providing personal 
services, e-commerce, e-government services 
and other various and different interactive such 
as e-health, e-education and social networks. 
Increasingly  providing  and  spreading  services 
online  in  daily  life  has  radically  changed  our 
economies and societies, making the provision 
of  these  services  a  must  for  building  the 
internet economy.

increasingly 

On  the  other  hand,  the  Egyptian  government 
has  been 
concerned  with 
enhancing resources,  encouraging investments, 
rationalizing  expenditures  and  distributing 
the  basic  resources  in  an  equitable    and  fair 
manner. ICT networks play a basic role in this 
context,  since  communication  networks  and 
the internet are part of the country’s economic 
infrastructure,  especially  in  banking  services, 
e-commerce,  trading  and  financing  system. 
Communication networks and IT also play, on 
the  political,  economic  and  social  levels,  a 
major role affecting citizens’ daily life through 
different  applications  such  as  e-government, 
e-voting, education and health services, etc…

Hence,  a  pressing  need  appeared 
for 
developing a national project for managing the 
digital identity based on a clear and integrated 
strategy.  Indeed, the management of the digital 

identity with its various levels is considered one 
of  the  most  important  processes  for  securing 
and organizing transactions electronically. This 
initiative involves developing the infrastructure, 
technologies  and  policies  required  to  create, 
identify, manage and coordinate the ownership, 
use  and  protection  of  personal  information, 
including a framework to define digital identity 
data for government information systems and 
individuals and entities executing transactions 
via the internet.

Description:

for 
regulating  and 
transactions.  Digital 

Digital  identity  management,  at  its  different 
levels, is considered one of the most important 
securing 
operations 
cyberspace 
identity 
consists  of  all  credentials  and  attributes 
related  to  an  individual  on  the  internet, 
such  as  the  computer  IP  address,  the  email 
address,  passwords,  user  name  or  nickname 
used in chatting rooms and forums, electronic 
account on websites that require a registered 
account for participation and activities. It also 
includes  bank  account  numbers  authorizing 
the person to deal with his/her bank account 
electronically  through  the  bank’s  website  on 
the  Internet,  transfer  of  funds,  services  and 
billing.  It  also  includes  e-  commerce,  where 
users  can  purchase  via  the  internet  using 
credit  cards,  voting,  health  information  and 
data.  All  these  are  considered  examples  of 
electronic  identity  whose  importance  has 
increased with the penetration and expansion 
of internet access. Digital identity management 

60
61

for  facilities,  banking  sector,  individuals  and 
private  sector,  is  considered  one  of  the  most 
important mechanisms required for regulating 
transactions,  rationalizing  consumption,  and 
increasing  the  efficiency  of  availing  services 
which  require  careful  coordination  at  the 
national level.

The primary objectives of this initiative are:

Applying the highest level of security in the 
collection,  use  and  storage  of  documents 
containing  personal  data,  ensuring  that 
unnecessary  documents  are  removed  from 
storage  in  an  appropriate  manner  and  that 
information retrieval is fast and efficient

Providing  citizens  with  electronic  cards, 
containing  accurate  personal  and  biometric 
information,  including  electronic  signature, 
to  facilitate  and  secure  transactions  with 
government authorities

Increasing  the  ease  and  speed  of  checking 
user  data  to  raise  performance  in  the 
provision of government services

Improving  the  quality  of  services  provided 
to  citizens  through  shared  use  of  digital 
identity  applications  and  records  by  various 
institutions

Improving and integrating operations systems 
for various government service providers to 
ensure  efficient  use  of  resources,  eliminate 
repetition of routine procedures, and focus on 
raising service quality

Helping  organizations  control  and  secure 
the  flow  of  information  with  partners  and 
customers, and to cooperate with each other, 
thereby promoting economic growth

Promoting use of digital identity applications 
to  facilitate  the  provision  and  use  of  local, 
regional  and 
international  services  by 
institutions  and  individuals,  saving  time, 
effort and money

Reducing threats to data security and privacy 
by  limiting  the  amount  of  data  circulated 
between institutions to that which is essential

Facilitating the collection of accurate statistics 
and the formulation of plans for all sectors of 
the economy

Supporting all sectors of the economy through 
the  exchange  and  updating  of  information 
via a central source

innovation 

Encouraging 
the  market, 
the  creation  of  new  job  opportunities  and 
increasing foreign trade

Facilitating  an  effective 
response  and 
the  ability  to  adapt  to  internet  threats  by 
increasing security on the internet, reducing 
cybercrime, improving the safety of networks 
and systems, raising overall safety levels for

MCIT  and  the  ICT  sector  in  Egypt  consider 
the  support  of  Arabic  digital  content  on 
the  internet,  a  top  priority  that  allows  the 
internet 
reach  more  Arabic-speaking 
communities  around  the  world,  and  hence 
preserving  and  promoting  Arab  heritage  and 
identity for coming generations. These efforts 
are  of  great  importance  given  that  Arabic 
online  content  is  estimated  to  constitute 
only  about  1%  to  1.5%  of  the  global  totals. 
The  Arabic  content 
includes 
hardcopy and soft copy outputs, all forms of 
media,  culture,  service  and  communication 
products  such  as  books,  musical  recordings, 
databases,  newspapers  and  magazines, 
heritage  documents,  multimedia,  software, 
governmental documents, scientific publishing, 
radio and personal programs, product catalogues, 
business  activity  documents,  photo  banks, 
patents, etc. Hence it is an integrated industrial 
process,  information  building  industry  and  a 
structuring of its investment as per user needs. 
MCIT  works  to  develop  the  Arabic  digital 
content industry in Egypt  in cooperation with 
local,  regional  and  international  organizations 
such  as  the  Arab  League,  ESCWA,  UNESCO, 
the  International  Telecommunication  Union 
in  addition  to  stakeholders  from  the  private 
sector, government and civil society.

Description:

The  Arabic  Digital  Content  Initiative  aims  at 
enhancing  Arabic  digital  content  production 
and  promoting  its  use  in  order  to  support 
human  and  social  development,  facilitate 
Egypt’s 
to  a  knowledge-based 
society,  and  preserve  and  promote  Arab  and 
Islamic  heritage  and  identity.  This  requires 

transition 

the  establishment  of  a  strong  digital  content 
industry,  providing  content  in  written,  audio 
and  visual  formats  accessible  through 
various  channels,  and  the  development  and 
enrichment  of  creative  Arabic  digital  content. 
The  initiative  involves  cooperation  between 
Arab  countries  to  integrate  efforts  in  the 
development  of  Arabic  digital  content,  share 
resources, experience and expertise, and avoid 
duplication of efforts.

The primary objectives of this initiative are:

Establishing a national strategy with a clear 
vision  and  objectives  to  enrich  and  digitize 
Arabic  content,  promote  creativity  in  the 
Arabic  digital  content  industry,  and  develop 
indicators to monitor and evaluate progress

Promoting the creation and dissemination of 
public sector information/ open government 
data

Promoting  the  digitization 
industry  and 
developing  an  easily  replicable  model  for 
content creation

Providing a suitable legislative and regulatory 
environment to protect Arabic content

Promoting research and development in the 
field of Arabic language technology

Promoting  the  development  of  tools  to 
enrich Arabic content and the improvement 
of  infrastructure  through  use  of  advanced 
technologies

7.3 Educational Reform Initiative based on ICTs, Cloud Computing and the Tablet Computer

Development of Egypt’s education system is 
a  national  priority  given  the  importance  of 
education to development and progress in all 
fields. MCIT in cooperation with the Ministry 
of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, 
the Ministry of Scientific Research and other 
stakeholders  has  adopted  various  strategies 
and  initiatives  over  the  years  supporting 
education  development.  Through  public-
private  partnerships,  MCIT  has  succeeded 
in  integrating  ICTs  in  the  education  system, 
developing the capabilities of teaching staff 
and  students,  and  expanding  the  role  of 
educational institutions in their communities.

Looking forward, cloud-computing technologies 
offer great potential in the field of education. 
As teaching materials and resources are stored 
on  central  databases,  they  are  accessible 
anywhere,  at  any  time,  via  the  internet.  This 
reduces  costs  for  educational  institutions  as 
they  can  access  content  on  a  pay-per-use 
basis  rather  than  having  to  purchase  various 
software packages and licenses and maintain 
equipment  with  sufficient  processing  power 
and  memory  to  store  and  use  them.  As  this 
system  can  be  accessed  anywhere  with  an 
internet  connection,  the  space  occupied  by 
static computer labs can be developed for other 
uses. Cloud computing also supports the work 
of  scientists  and  researchers,  and  promotes 
economic  growth  by 
reducing  education 
expenditure and promoting local production of 
digital  education  materials,  cloud  computing 
software and tablet computers.

The primary objectives of the Initiative are:

Strengthening  the  national  commitment  to 
building a model of educational reform that 
can be replicated in other Arab and African 
countries

Promoting  research  and  development  and 
supporting  scientific  research  in  the  field  of 
ICT for education

Establishing  a  culture  of  e-learning  among 
public  and  private  educational  institutions 
and  developing  e-courses  for  use  in  state 
education

Developing  regulations  and  mechanisms 
covering the production and use of e-learning 
materials  by  educational  institutions,  and 
determining standards for the evaluation of 
such materials

B o o s t i n g   t h e   i n te r n e t   e co n o m y   and 
creating new job opportunities

Providing Egyptian producers of digital content 
and  applications  with  new  opportunities  to 
reach large numbers of learners at low cost

Raising  the  contribution  of  the  electronics 
industry in the GDP

Developing the technology skills of university 
teaching staff and students

Developing  the  skills  of  engineers  and 
technicians for work in the electronics industry 
(Tablet Computer) to support national growth

Establishing  a  plan  for  sustainable 
environmental  protection  and  management 
of natural resources, energy and e-waste.

7.4 Back to Africa Initiative
Egypt  enjoys  strong  historical  and  cultural 
ties with the Africa continent.  These ties are 
particularly strong with the Nile Basin countries. 
The Egyptian government seeks to build on its 
long-standing  relations  in  Africa  in  all  fields, 
and since the 25 January Revolution this goal 
has been designated a national priority.

In this context, the Back to Africa Initiative seeks 
to use Egypt’s progress in the ICT sector, in terms 
of infrastructure, policies and human resources, 
to  further  strengthen  its  ties  throughout  the 
continent on the bilateral and regional levels, 
while promoting sustainable human and social 
development  and  establishing  a  strong  ICT 
infrastructure, that would contribute to bridging 
the digital divide in Africa.

A- Bilateral Cooperation

Aiming  at strengthening bilateral relations between 
Egypt  and  African  countries;  strengthening  the 
role  of  the  Egyptian  private  sector  by  boosting  
Egyptian  investments  in  infrastructure  projects,  
where Egyptian companies enjoy a relatively large 
experience, and supporting development projects  
through human capacity building  programs

B- Regional Cooperation

By re activating  Egypt’s involvement  in relevant 
regional  organizations.  This  role    enhances 
Egypt’s  position  in the continent and ensures 
many economic benefits.   The ICT sector plays 
an  important  role  in  regional  cooperation

      Initiative
Ensuring  communication  with  all  segments 
of  the  Egyptian  society  and  providing  ICT  for 
development  services  are  two  of  the  most 
important  objectives  of  the  ministry.  In  order 
to  achieve  these  objectives,  the  ministry  has 
worked  since  its  inception  to  build  a  strong 
information  society.  However,  and  despite 
all effort, the needs of PWD remains a major 
challenge.    

MCIT  is  paying  a  special  attention  to  people 
with  disabilities  in  the  2012-  2017  sector 
strategy.  The ministry is currently working on 
a  long-term  strategy  with  the  participation 
of  representatives  of  this  group  that  focuses

with disabilities, and to ensure they are able to 
enjoy their full rights, make decisions for their 
lives based on their free and informed consent, 
and function as active members of society.

In  the  same  year,  Egypt  held  the  First  Arab 
Regional  Forum  on  Sharing  Experience  on 
Best Practices in ICT Services for Persons with 
Disabilities.  The  resulting  Cairo  Declaration 
on  Supporting  Access  to  Information  and

The primary objectives of this initiative are:

Supporting sustainable development on the 
national level

Accelerating economic growth by encouraging 
investment in green ICT

Setting national policies for green ICT

Raising  public  awareness  of  ICTs  and  their 
relation to the environment

Building human capacity in green ICT

Promoting the adoption of smart and energy-
saving ICT solutions

Promoting research in the field of green ICT

Promoting use of green ICTs in all sectors

Promoting  sustainable  management  of  ICT 
equipment from procurement to recycling

Formulating policies that promote reuse and 
recycling of ICT equipment

In line with Egypt’s aim to reduce greenhouse 
gas  emissions  and  play  an  active  role  in 
international  efforts  to  promote  sustainable 
development  both  locally  and  internationally, 
programs have been adopted in a number of 
sectors  to  reduce  emissions  and  protect  the 
environment.

In  this  context,  the  ICT  sector  has  a  special 
role to play in reducing emissions and limiting 
the  environmental  impact  not  only  of  its 
own  activities  but  across  all  sectors,  thereby 
supporting  sustainable  economic  and  social 
development. On a global level, the sector has 
the potential to significantly reduce emissions 
in other sectors for only a low increase in its 
own emissions.

MCIT’s  efforts  in  the  field  of  green  ICT  –  in 
cooperation  with  governmental  and  non-
governmental 
international 
organizations and the private sector – include 
programs in the following areas of focus:

organizations, 

Sustainable  management  and  development 
of the ICT sector:

Establishing  a  framework  for  the  Green  ICT 
Strategy for 2012-2015

8.1 Monitoring and Evaluation

Given  the  pivotal  role  of  the  ICT  sector  in  the 
development  and  growth  of  all  sectors  of  the 
economy,  and  the  cross-  sectoral  nature  of 
many  of  the  programs  and  initiatives  of  the 
National  ICT  Strategy  for  2012-2017,  MCIT  has 
adopted  an  integrated  approach  to  monitoring 
and evaluating the implementation of activities 
related to the strategy.

This approach rests on three axes, as follows:

First: Executive Structure

The framework for decision-making, determination 
of priorities and monitoring work depends on three 
main pillars:

Executive structure: Formation of an integrated 
group  of  committees  to  monitor  programs/ 
initiatives at all levels, with the inclusion of a 
number of primary beneficiaries

Human  resources:  Selection  of  committee 
members according to their areas of expertise

Information: Preparation of periodic reports on 
programs/ initiatives to assist decision makers 
and  committee  members 
in  monitoring 
progress and taking necessary action

Second: Monitoring and Evaluation Processes

Third: Analysis of Project Outcomes

Table 8.2: ICT Indicators Development Program

Project  outcomes  are  to  be  evaluated  based 
on  efficiency,  effectiveness  and  sustainability, 
providing valuable information for the expansion 
or replication of programs.

Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  progress  and 
performance  in  the  various  programs  and 
initiatives of the strategy requires the collection 
of  data  during  project  implementation  for 
periodic  analysis  in  reference  to  project  plans 
and  agreed  standards,  after  which  an  array  of 
indicators are determined to assess outputs.

The evaluation strategy is based on three main 
axes, as follows:

1- Development of ICT sector performance  
    indicators

2- Monitoring and Follow-up:

Monitoring project inputs in order to improve 
operational frameworks

Monitoring project activities and following up 
to achieve desired outcomes

Monitoring  factors  that  could  affect  project 
implementation  with  a  view  to  developing 
solutions

Evaluating project outputs using clear indicators 
to assess levels of achievement against initial 
targets

Following  up  with  project  beneficiaries  to 
gather perceptions, comments and complaints

Financial follow-up of projects

3- Assessing Change in Target Categories

Ongoing  assessment  of  project  outputs 
during  the  implementation  phase  followed 
by  evaluation  of  outcomes  in  relation  to 
initial plans

Participatory  approach  to  monitoring  and 
evaluation  where  project  partners  cooperate 
in assessments

8.2  Conclusion

The  efforts  of  MCIT  since  its  establishment 
in  1999  have  led  to  the  emergence  of  an 
ICT  sector  that  has  driven  forward  human, 
social  and  economic  development  on  the 
national  level,  and  earned  a  solid  reputation 
both  regionally  and  internationally.  With  the 
National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017, MCIT aims 
to  promote  the  continued  growth  of  Egypt’s 
ICT  sector,  which  has  an  important  role  to 
play  in  supporting  the  country’s  transition  to 
democracy.

The  initiatives  and  programs  of  the  strategy, 
which cover a wide range of themes and sectors, 
are being implemented through public- private 
partnerships  –  involving  cooperation  between 
MCIT, other ministries and government entities, 
civil  society  organizations, 
regional  and 
international  organizations,  and  the  private 
sector. MCIT favors this approach as the sharing 
of responsibilities and efforts, and the resulting 
successes, guarantees the active engagement 
of stakeholders in the future of the sector and 
society at large.
