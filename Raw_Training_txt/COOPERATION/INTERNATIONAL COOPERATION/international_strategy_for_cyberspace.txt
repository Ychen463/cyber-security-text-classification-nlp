I. Building Cyberspace Policy

“This world—cyberspace—is a world that we depend on every single 
day... [it] has made us more interconnected than at any time in human 
history.” 

—President Barack Obama, May 29, 2009

Digital infrastructure is increasingly the backbone of prosperous economies, vigorous research com-
munities, strong militaries, transparent governments, and free societies  As never before, information 
technology is fostering transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of goods and services  
These social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives  Critical life-sustaining 
infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, control air traffic, and support our financial system all 
depend on networked information systems  Governments are now able to streamline the provision of 
essential services through eGovernment initiatives  Social and political movements rely on the Internet 
to enable new and more expansive forms of organization and action  The reach of networked technol-
ogy is pervasive and global  For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become 
a national asset 

To realize fully the benefits that networked technology promises the world, these systems must func-
tion reliably and securely  People must have confidence that data will travel to its destination without 
disruption  Assuring the free flow of information, the security and privacy of data, and the integrity of 
the interconnected networks themselves are all essential to American and global economic prosperity, 
security, and the promotion of universal rights 

Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and countless more are touched by it in their 
daily lives  There are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world today  Scarcely a half-
century ago, that number was zero  We live in a rare historical moment with an opportunity to build on 
cyberspace’s successes and help secure its future for U S  citizens and the global community 

For these technologies to continue to empower individuals, enrich societies, and foster the research, 
development, and innovation essential to building modern economies, it must retain the openness and 
interoperability that have characterized its explosive growth  Underlying these are technical principles 
and effective governance structures that demand our support  At the same time, our networks must be 
secure and reliable; they must retain the trust of individuals, businesses and governments, and should 
be resilient to arbitrary or malicious disruption 

The world must collectively recognize the challenges posed by malevolent actors’ entry into cyberspace, 
and update and strengthen our national and international policies accordingly  Activities undertaken 
in cyberspace have consequences for our lives in physical space, and we must work towards building 
the rule of law, to prevent the risks of logging on from outweighing its benefits  The future of an open, 
interoperable, secure and reliable cyberspace depends on nations recognizing and safeguarding that 
which should endure, while confronting those who would destabilize or undermine our increasingly 
networked world

Strategic Approach
The foundation of the United States’ international cyberspace policy is the belief that networked tech-
nologies hold immense potential for our Nation, and for the world  Over the last three decades we, the 
United States, have watched these technologies revolutionize our economy and transform of our daily 
lives  We have also witnessed offline challenges, like exploitation and aggression, move into cyberspace  
As we adapt to meet those challenges, we will lead by example  The United States will pursue an inter-
national cyberspace policy that empowers the innovation that drives our economy and improves lives 
here and abroad  In all this work, we are grounded in principles essential not just to American foreign 
policy, but to the future of the Internet itself 

Building on Successes
The United States is committed to preserving and enhancing the benefits of digital networks to 
our societies and economies.

These benefits have been diverse and profound  For individuals, computer networks have enhanced 
productivity and prosperity; helped to overcome disadvantage and disability; brought together those 
isolated by language or a rare disease; connected families and friends across distant and often-fraught 
borders  For communities, they have sped first response to emergencies, expanded information-sharing 
to help solve crimes, shed light on corruption, facilitated political action, and brought wide attention 
to overlooked causes  For businesses, they have opened new markets and spawned billion-dollar 
industries  For governments, they have enabled increased transparency, efficiency, and convenience, 
and have connected leaders to those they serve  For the international community, they have provided 
the foundation for a new global marketplace of ideas, and helped channel remarkable generosity in the 
face of tragedy  The more freely information flows, the stronger our societies become  Properly used, 
these technologies can strengthen us all, and we will work to expand their reach and improve their 
operation at home and abroad  

Recognizing the Challenges
The United States acknowledges that the growth of these networks brings with it new challenges 
for our national and economic security and that of the global community. 

These challenges come in a variety of forms  Natural disasters, accidents, or sabotage can disrupt cables, 
servers, and wireless networks on U S  soil and beyond  Technical challenges can be equally disruptive, 
as one country’s method for blocking a website can cascade into a much larger, international network 
disruption  Extortion, fraud, identity theft, and child exploitation can threaten users’ confidence in online 
commerce, social networks and even their personal safety  The theft of intellectual property threatens 
national competitiveness and the innovation that drives it  These challenges transcend national borders; 
low costs of entry to cyberspace and the ability to establish an anonymous virtual presence can also 
lead to “safe havens” for criminals, with or without a state’s knowledge  Cybersecurity threats can even 
endanger international peace and security more broadly, as traditional forms of conflict are extended 
into cyberspace

Grounded in Principle
The United States will confront these challenges—while preserving our core principles. 

Our policies flow from a commitment to both preserving the best of cyberspace and safeguarding our 
principles  Our international cyberspace policy reflects our core commitments to fundamental freedoms, 
privacy, and the free flow of information 

Fundamental Freedoms  Our commitment to freedom of expression and association is abiding, but does 
not come at the expense of public safety or the protection of our citizens  Among these civil liberties, 
recognized internationally as “fundamental freedoms,” the ability to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas through any medium and regardless of frontiers has never been more relevant  As a nation, we 
are not blind to those Internet users with malevolent intentions, but recognize that exceptions to free 
speech in cyberspace must also be narrowly tailored  For example, child pornography, inciting imminent 
violence, or organizing an act of terrorism have no place in any society, and thus, they have no place on 
the Internet  Nonetheless, the United States will continue to combat them in a manner consistent with 
our core values—treating these issues specifically, and not as referenda on the Internet’s value to society 

Privacy  Our strategy marries our obligation to protect our citizens and interests with our commitment 
to privacy  As citizens increasingly engage via the Internet in their public and private lives, they have 
expectations for privacy: individuals should be able to understand how their personal data may be 
used, and be confident that it will be handled fairly  Likewise, they expect to be protected from fraud, 
theft, and threats to personal safety that lurk online—and expect law enforcement to use all the tools 
at their disposal, pursuant to law, to track and prosecute those who would use the Internet to exploit 
others  The United States is committed to ensuring balance on both sides of this equation, by giving law 
enforcement appropriate investigative authorities it requires, while protecting individual rights through 
appropriate judicial review and oversight to ensure consistency with the rule of law 

Free Flow of Information  States do not, and should not have to choose between the free flow of infor-
mation and the security of their networks  The best cybersecurity solutions are dynamic and adaptable, 
with minimal impact on network performance  These tools secure systems without crippling innovation, 
suppressing freedom of expression or association, or impeding global interoperability  In contrast, we see 
other approaches—such as national-level filters and firewalls—as providing only an illusion of security 
while hampering the effectiveness and growth of the Internet as an open, interoperable, secure, and 
reliable medium of exchange  The same is true commercially; cyberspace must remain a level playing 
field that rewards innovation, entrepreneurship, and industriousness, not a venue where states arbi-
trarily disrupt the free flow of information to create unfair advantage  The United States is committed to 
international initiatives and standards that enhance cybersecurity while safeguarding free trade and the 
broader free flow of information, recognizing our global responsibilities, as well as our national needs  

Too often, such principles are characterized as incompatible with effective law enforcement, anonymity, 
the protection of children and secure infrastructure  In reality, good cybersecurity can enhance privacy, 
and effective law enforcement targeting widely-recognized illegal behavior can protect fundamental 
freedoms  The rule of law—a civil order in which fidelity to laws safeguards people and interests; brings 
stability to global markets; and holds malevolent actors to account internationally—both supports our 
national security and advances our common values

II. Cyberspace’s future

Envision a future in which reliable access to the Internet is available from nearly any point on the globe, 
at a price that businesses and families can afford  Computers can communicate with one another across 
a seamless landscape of global networks permitting trusted, instantaneous communication with friends 
and colleagues down the block or around the world  Content is offered in local languages and flows 
freely beyond national borders, as improvements in digital translation open to millions a wealth of 
knowledge, new ideas, and rich debates  New technologies improving agriculture or promoting public 
health are shared with those in greatest need, and difficult problems benefit from global collaboration 
among experts and innovators  This, in part, is the future of cyberspace that the United States seeks—and 
the future we will work to realize 

In this future, individuals and businesses can quickly and easily obtain the tools necessary to set up their 
own presence online; domain names and addresses are available, secure, and properly maintained, 
without onerous licenses or unreasonable disclosures of personal information  The best engineers work 
together internationally to develop new standards for information systems that make networks faster 
and more reliable, catalyzing innovation and expanding accessibility  High-tech industry works with its 
customers to provide software, hardware, and services that are more secure, more reliable, and more 
responsive to their needs 

It is a future in which universities and companies are free to research and develop new concepts and 
products because they know their intellectual property and valuable data are safe, even on shared 
networks  Individuals know the threats to their personal computers, and can take easy-to-use measures 
to protect their systems  Private-sector companies also take a responsibility for their network hygiene, 
knowing that in so doing, they protect their investments  When cybersecurity incidents demand 
government action, officials can detect those threats early and share data in real-time to mitigate the 
spread of malware or minimize the impact of a major disruption—all while preserving the broader free 
flow of information  When a crime is committed internationally, law enforcement agencies are able to 
collaborate to safeguard and share evidence and bring individuals to justice  

This future promises not just greater prosperity and more reliable networks, but enhanced international 
security and a more sustainable peace  In it, states act as responsible parties in cyberspace—whether 
configuring networks in ways that will spare others disruption, or inhibiting criminals from using the 
Internet to operate from safe havens  States know that networked infrastructure must be protected, 
and they take measures to secure it from disruption and sabotage  They continue to collaborate bilater-
ally, multilaterally, and internationally to bring more of the world into the information age and into the 
consensus of states that seek to preserve the Internet and its core characteristics  

The United States and a growing number of partners have laid the foundation for this future already  But 
it is not a foregone conclusion, and we cannot build it alone  Though progress may be slow and resource-
intensive, the international community must join together in support of this long-term investment  We 
must do so with the clear understanding that this vision of cyberspace serves national interests as much 
as shared international aims  The measure of our success will be another half-century of information 
technology as transformational as the last, as we begin to realize fully the benefits—and minimize the 
risks—of global interconnection

The Future We Seek
The cyberspace environment that we seek rewards innovation and empowers individuals; it connects 
individuals and strengthens communities; it builds better governments and expands accountability; 
it safeguards fundamental freedoms and enhances personal privacy; it builds understanding, clarifies 
norms of behavior, and enhances national and international security  To sustain this environment, 
international collaboration is more than a best practice; it is a first principle 

Our Goal

The United States will work internationally to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable  
information and communications infrastructure that supports international trade and commerce, 
strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and innovation  To achieve that goal, we will 
build and sustain an environment in which norms of responsible behavior guide states’ actions, sustain 
partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace  

Open and Interoperable: A Cyberspace That Empowers
At the core of digital innovation is the ability to add new functionality to networked machines  The 
openness of digital systems explains their explosive growth, rapid development, and enduring impor-
tance  Networked technology’s basic tools are steadily increasing in availability and decreasing in price, 
as computer and Internet access have spread to every nation  To continue to serve the needs of an 
ever-growing wired population, manufacturers of hardware and operating systems must continue to 
empower the widest possible range of developers across the globe  As companies continue to drive 
innovation in the development of proprietary software, we also applaud the vibrancy of the open-source 
software movement, giving developers and consumers the choice of community-driven solutions to 
meet their needs 

The United States supports an Internet with end-to-end interoperability, which allows people world-
wide to connect to knowledge, ideas, and one another through technology that meets their needs  
The free flow of information depends on interoperability—a principle affirmed by 174 nations in the 
Tunis Commitment of the World Summit on the Information Society  The alternative to global openness 
and interoperability is a fragmented Internet, where large swaths of the world’s population would be 
denied access to sophisticated applications and rich content because of a few nations’ political interests  
The collaborative development of consensus-based international standards for information and com-
munication technology is a key part of preserving openness and interoperability, growing our digital 
economies, and moving our societies forward 

Secure and Reliable: A Cyberspace That Endures
For cyberspace as we know it to endure, our networked systems must retain our trust  Users need to 
have confidence that their data will be secure in transit and storage, as well as reliable in delivery  An 
effective strategy will require action on many fronts, with shared responsibility at every level of society, 
from the end-user up through collaboration among nation-states

II.  CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure

Vulnerability reduction will require robust technical standards and solutions, effective incident manage-
ment, trustworthy hardware and software, and secure supply chains  Risk reduction on a global scale 
will require effective law enforcement; internationally agreed norms of state behavior; measures that 
build confidence and enhance transparency; active, informed diplomacy; and appropriate deterrence  
Finally, incident response will require increased collaboration and technical information sharing with the 
private sector and international community  This work cannot be fully addressed by any single nation 
or sector alone; it is a responsibility and duty that every nation, and its people, all share 

Network stability is a cornerstone of our global prosperity, and securing those networks is more than 
strictly a technical matter  Economically, we must advance sustainable growth and invest in infrastructure 
at home and abroad, while incentivizing network reliability and clarifying the obligations of firms and 
states  Politically, we must help to maintain an environment of respect for technical infrastructure, so 
disputes do not become excuses to disrupt and degrade networks  Socially, we must make end-users 
aware of their responsibilities to maintain and operate their devices in a safe and secure manner  

Stability Through Norms
The United States will work with like-minded states to establish an environment of expectations, or 
norms of behavior, that ground foreign and defense policies and guide international partnerships  The 
last two decades have seen the swift and unprecedented growth of the Internet as a social medium; 
the growing reliance of societies on networked information systems to control critical infrastructures 
and communications systems essential to modern life; and increasing evidence that governments are 
seeking to exercise traditional national power through cyberspace  These events have not been matched 
by clearly agreed-upon norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace  To bridge that gap, we will 
work to build a consensus on what constitutes acceptable behavior, and a partnership among those 
who view the functioning of these systems as essential to the national and collective interest 

The Role of Norms  In other spheres of international relations, shared understandings about accept-
able behavior have enhanced stability and provided a basis for international action when corrective 
measures are required  Adherence to such norms brings predictability to state conduct, helping prevent 
the misunderstandings that could lead to conflict 

The development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary 
international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete  Long-standing international 
norms guiding state behavior—in times of peace and conflict—also apply in cyberspace  Nonetheless, 
unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply 
and what additional understandings might be necessary to supplement them  We will continue to work 
internationally to forge consensus regarding how norms of behavior apply to cyberspace, with the 
understanding that an important first step in such efforts is applying the broad expectations of peaceful 
and just interstate conduct to cyberspace

The Basis for Norms  Rules that promote order and peace, advance basic human dignity, and promote 
freedom in economic competition are essential to any international environment  These principles pro-
vide a basic roadmap for how states can meet their traditional international obligations in cyberspace 
and, in many cases, reflect duties of states that apply regardless of context  The existing principles that 
should support cyberspace norms include:

 • Upholding Fundamental Freedoms:  States must respect fundamental freedoms of expression 

and association, online as well as off 

 • Respect for Property:  States should in their undertakings and through domestic laws respect 

intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and copyrights 

 • Valuing Privacy:  Individuals should be protected from arbitrary or unlawful state interference 

with their privacy when they use the Internet 

 • Protection from Crime:  States must identify and prosecute cybercriminals, to ensure laws and 
practices deny criminals safe havens, and cooperate with international criminal investigations 
in a timely manner 

 • Right of Self-Defense:  Consistent with the United Nations Charter, states have an inherent 

right to self-defense that may be triggered by certain aggressive acts in cyberspace 

Deriving from these traditional principles of interstate conduct are responsibilities more specific to 
cyberspace, focused in particular on preserving global network functionality and improving cyberse-
curity  Many of these responsibilities are rooted in the technical realities of the Internet  Because the 
Internet’s core functionality relies on systems of trust (such as the Border Gateway Protocol), states 
need to recognize the international implications of their technical decisions, and act with respect for 
one another’s networks and the broader Internet  Likewise, in designing the next generation of these 
systems, we must advance the common interest by supporting the soundest technical standards and 
governance structures, rather than those that will simply enhance national prestige or political control  
Emerging norms, also essential to this space, include:

 • Global Interoperability:  States should act within their authorities to help ensure the end-to-

end interoperability of an Internet accessible to all 

 • Network Stability:  States should respect the free flow of information in national network 
configurations, ensuring they do not arbitrarily interfere with internationally interconnected 
infrastructure 

 • Reliable Access:  States should not arbitrarily deprive or disrupt individuals’ access to the 

Internet or other networked technologies 

 • Multi-stakeholder Governance:  Internet governance efforts must not be limited to govern-

ments, but should include all appropriate stakeholders 

 • Cybersecurity Due Diligence:  States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect 

information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse

II.  CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure

While cyberspace is a dynamic environment, international behavior in it must be grounded in the 
principles of responsible domestic governance, peaceful interstate conduct, and reliable network 
management  As these ideas develop, the United States will foster and participate fully in discussions, 
advancing a principled approach to Internet policy-making and developing shared understandings in 
fora appropriate to each issue 

Our Role in Cyberspace’s Future
To realize this future and help promulgate positive norms, the United States will combine diplomacy, 
defense, and development to enhance prosperity, security, and openness so all can benefit from net-
worked technology  These three approaches are central to our efforts internationally  In the latter half of 
the 20th century, the United States helped forge a new post-war architecture of international economic 
and security cooperation  In the 21st century, we will work to realize this vision of a peaceful and reliable 
cyberspace in that same spirit of cooperation and collective responsibility 

Diplomacy: Strengthening Partnerships
Extending the principles of peace and security to cyberspace—while preserving its benefits and charac-
ter—will require strengthened partnerships and expanded initiatives  We will engage the international 
community in frank and urgent dialogue, to build consensus around principles of responsible behavior 
in cyberspace and the actions necessary, both domestically and as an international community, to build 
a system of cyberspace stability 

Diplomatic Objective

The United States will work to create incentives for, and build consensus around, an international envi-
ronment in which states—recognizing the intrinsic value of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable 
cyberspace—work together and act as responsible stakeholders  

Strengthening Partnerships
Through our international relationships and affiliations, we will seek to ensure that as many stakeholders 
as possible are included in this vision of cyberspace precisely because of its economic, social, political, 
and security benefits  These efforts will be supported by meaningful collaboration with the private 
sector at home and abroad  

Distributed systems require distributed action, and no single institution, document, arrangement, or 
instrument could suffice in addressing the needs of our networked world  From end-users, private-sector 
hardware and software vendors, and Internet service providers, to regional, multilateral, and multi-
stakeholder organizations—all are important in helping cyberspace meet its full potential  

In the international arena in particular, states have an enduring role to play in preserving peace and 
stability, empowering innovation, safeguarding economic and national security interests, and protecting 
and promoting the individual rights of citizens  In our international relations, the United States will work 
to establish an environment of international expectations that anchor foreign and defense policies and 
strengthen our international relationships

Bilateral and Multilateral Partnerships  We will work bilaterally with nations to build collaboration on 
cyberspace issues important to our governments and our peoples  Building broad international under-
standing about cyberspace norms of behavior must begin with clear agreement among like-minded 
countries  We will seek a broad community of partners in these efforts, and will include cyberspace 
issues in a wide range of bilateral dialogues, at all levels of government and across a wide range of our 
activities  We will advance common action on cyberspace’s emerging challenges, while building on those 
enforcement tools and approaches already enjoying success  Furthermore, we will actively engage the 
developing world, and ensure that emerging voices on these issues are heard 

International and Multi-stakeholder Organizations  Regional organizations have been particularly 
effective at tackling cybersecurity problems specific to their members  They will play an increasingly 
important role in developing and applying norms of behavior  We will continue to use our membership 
in these organizations, as well as in broader international organizations, to develop productive agendas 
that are appropriate to each organization’s expertise and that realize concrete benefits for members  In 
Internet governance policy, important steps have been made to ensure responsiveness and international 
representation in key organizations  The United States salutes those efforts, and will continue to recog-
nize the unique contribution of such fora that represent the entire Internet community by integrating 
the private sector, civil society, academia, as well as governments in a multi-stakeholder environment  

Private Sector Collaboration  Although the private sector already plays an important role in international 
and multi-stakeholder organizations, we will continue to leverage existing partnership mechanisms to 
engage with industry partners  In particular, we will work closely with infrastructure owners and opera-
tors—who are responsible for the majority of network functionality—to expand initiatives to secure the 
network ecosystem, preserve the benefits and character of cyberspace, avoid unnecessary impediments 
to technological evolution, and extend principles of peace and security  We also seek the private sector’s 
participation in Internet governance as essential to upholding its multi-stakeholder character, and will 
continue to advocate for inclusiveness in fora that take up such issues 

Defense: Dissuading and Deterring 
The United States will defend its networks, whether the threat comes from terrorists, cybercriminals, or 
states and their proxies  Just as importantly, we will seek to encourage good actors and dissuade and 
deter those who threaten peace and stability through actions in cyberspace  We will do so with over-
lapping policies that combine national and international network resilience with vigilance and a range 
of credible response options  In all our defense endeavors, we will protect civil liberties and privacy in 
accordance with our laws and principles 

Defense Objective

The United States will, along with other nations, encourage responsible behavior and oppose those who 
would seek to disrupt networks and systems, dissuading and deterring malicious actors, and reserving the 
right to defend these vital national assets as necessary and appropriate  

12★

Dissuasion
Protecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities  The United States will 
continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disrup-
tions and other attacks  For those more sophisticated attacks that do create damage, we will act on 
well-developed response plans to isolate and mitigate disruption to our machines, limiting effects on 
our networks, and potential cascade effects beyond them 

Strength at Home  Ensuring the resilience of our networks and information systems requires collective 
and concerted national action that spans the whole of government, in collaboration with the private sec-
tor and individual citizens  For a decade, the United States has been fostering a culture of cybersecurity 
and an effective apparatus for risk mitigation and incident response  We continue to emphasize that 
systematically adopting sound information technology practices—across the public and private sec-
tors—will reduce our Nation’s vulnerabilities and strengthen networks and systems  We are also making 
steady progress towards shared situational awareness of network vulnerabilities and risks among public 
and private sector networks  We have built new initiatives through our national computer security inci-
dent response team to share information among government, key industries, our critical infrastructure 
sectors, and other stakeholders  And we continually seek new ways to strengthen our partnership with 
the private sector to enhance the security of the systems on which we both rely  

Strength Abroad  This model of defense has been successfully shared internationally through education, 
training and ongoing operational and policy relationships  Today, through existing and developing 
collaborations in the technical and military defense arenas, nations share an unprecedented ability to 
recognize and respond to incidents—a crucial step in denying would-be attackers the ability to do lasting 
damage to our national and international networks  However, a globally distributed network requires 
globally distributed early warning capabilities  We must continue to produce new computer security 
incident response capabilities globally, and to facilitate their interconnection and enhanced computer 
network defense  The United States has a shared interest in assisting less developed nations to build 
capacity for defense, and in collaboration with our partners, will intensify our focus on this area  Building 
relationships with friends and allies will increase collective security across the international community 

Deterrence
The United States will ensure that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly 
outweigh the potential benefits  We fully recognize that cyberspace activities can have effects extending 
beyond networks; such events may require responses in self-defense  Likewise, interconnected networks 
link nations more closely, so an attack on one nation’s networks may have impact far beyond its borders 

In the case of criminals and other non-state actors who would threaten our national and economic secu-
rity, domestic deterrence requires all states have processes that permit them to investigate, apprehend, 
and prosecute those who intrude or disrupt networks at home or abroad  Internationally, law enforce-
ment organizations must work in concert with one another whenever possible to freeze perishable 
data vital to ongoing investigations, to work with legislatures and justice ministries to harmonize their 
approaches, and to promote due process and the rule of law—all key tenets of the Budapest Convention 
on Cybercrime 

13★

InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe

When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other 
threat to our country  All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain 
hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with 
our military treaty partners  We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, 
military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to 
defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests  In so doing, we will exhaust all options 
before military force whenever we can; will carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs 
of inaction; and will act in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, seeking broad 
international support whenever possible  

Development: Building Prosperity and Security
The United States will continue to demonstrate our conviction that the benefits of a connected world 
are universal  The virtues of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace should be more 
available than they are today, and as the world’s leading information economy, the United States is 
committed to ensuring others benefit from our technical resources and expertise  

Our Nation can and will play an active role in providing the knowledge and capacity to build and secure 
new and existing digital systems, and in so doing, build consensus among states to behave as respon-
sible stakeholders  Building capacity to realize these goals is not a short-term expenditure, but a wise 
long-term investment and a commitment on the part of our government for continued engagement  

Development Objective

The United States will facilitate cybersecurity capacity-building abroad, bilaterally and through multilateral 
organizations, so that each country has the means to protect its digital infrastructure, strengthen global net-
works, and build closer partnerships in the consensus for open, interoperable, secure, and reliable networks  

Building Technical Capacity
Access to networked technology is increasingly a basic need for development  Governments and indus-
try have made a number of meaningful steps to enhance connectivity to end-users across un-served 
or underserved regions  International information infrastructures continue to mature and expand, 
providing more nations with the opportunity to access the global flow of information  The growth of the 
networks worldwide, and expansion of access to them, enriches the world community, yet also presents 
new challenges and opportunities for collaboration on issues of traditional and cybersecurity  Much of 
this capacity will result from private-sector investment, and the United States will work with govern-
ments and industry to build a climate friendly to those efforts, and in which they can be leveraged to 
address countries’ core development needs 

14★

★

II.  CyBersPaCe’s  fuTure

Governments are a major determinant of whether this new connectivity produces positive outcomes or 
wastes its potential  Those states that have benefitted most from our capacity-building efforts are those 
that embrace technology to build prosperity and enhance social cohesion, rather than restrict access 
for the purposes of political control  For that reason, technical projects that the United States supports 
will by design enhance security and commerce, safeguard the free flow of information, and promote 
the global interoperability of networks 

Building Cybersecurity Capacity
Prosperity cannot be built on a foundation of fear and unreliability, and the United States is committed 
to helping build cybersecurity capacity alongside states’ own technological development  Enhancing 
national-level cybersecurity among developing nations is of immediate and long-term benefit, as more 
states are equipped to confront threats emanating from within their borders and in turn, build confi-
dence in globally interconnected networks and cooperate across borders to combat criminal misuse of 
information technologies  It is also essential to cultivating dynamic, international research communities 
able to take on next-generation challenges to cybersecurity  

Acknowledging that cybersecurity is a global issue that must be addressed with national efforts on the 
part of all countries, we will expand and regularize initiatives focused on cybersecurity capacity build-
ing—with enhanced focus on awareness-raising, legal and technical training, and support for policy 
development  Such programs must address more than purely technology issues; we will work with states 
to recognize the breadth of the cybersecurity challenge, assist them in developing their own strategies, 
and build capacity across the whole range of sectors—from network security and the establishment of 
Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERTs), to international law enforcement and defense collabo-
ration, to productive relationships with the domestic and international private sector and civil society  

Building Policy Relationships
The United States’ capacity-building assistance is envisioned as an investment, a commitment, and 
an important opportunity for dialogue and partnership  As countries develop a stake in cyberspace 
issues, we intend our dialogues to mature from capacity-building to active economic, technical, law 
enforcement, defense and diplomatic collaboration on issues of mutual concern  We will also facilitate 
relationships among countries developing cybersecurity capacity—using both regional fora and techni-
cal bodies possessing specialized expertise—and will continue to promote the sharing of best practices, 
lessons learned, and international technical exchanges 

15★

III. Policy Priorities

The United States will continue to take action to help build and sustain open, interoperable, secure, and 
reliable networks at home and abroad, both for our citizens and others in the global community  Our 
approach is guided by the fundamental principles, driven by the overarching goal, and sustained by 
the policies outlined in this document—together they form the basis of the United States’ international 
cyberspace strategy 

To fully realize this future in which cyberspace lives up to its potential for all, the United States 
Government organizes its activities across seven interdependent areas of activity, each demanding 
collaboration within our government, with international partners, and with the private sector  Taken as 
a whole, they form the action lines of our strategic framework 

For the many departments and agencies of the United States Government already engaged in these 
activities, they provide reinforcement to the important work already underway  For those developing 
implementation plans to carry out their specific responsibilities in cyberspace, they provide context 
and ensure unity of effort  The policy priorities outlined here call for and guide those specific actions, 
highlighting areas of past, present and future emphasis that demand concerted attention and resources 
at the national level  

Economy: Promoting International Standards and Innovative,  
Open Markets
To ensure that cyberspace continues to serve the needs of our economies and innovators, we will:

 • Sustain a free-trade environment that encourages technological innovation on accessible, 
globally linked networks. Just as the free flow of information is critical to the functioning of 
our networks, free trade helps support innovation and market growth in the information age  
The global embrace of the Internet can largely be traced to the spread of lower-cost and globally 
available computers and network technology  Competition in these markets drives innovation, 
while a free-trade environment enables manufacturers to keep prices competitive and standards 
high  Respecting the international standards of technology development and trade is an essen-
tial part of sustaining open markets, and enables leading-edge technology companies to rapidly 
deliver the benefits of their innovative products and services  Over the next few decades, the 
globalization of technology manufacturing will only increase, with substantial benefits for our 
networks and consumers  The United States will work to sustain that free-trade environment, 
particularly in support of the high-tech sector, to ensure future innovation 

 • Protect intellectual property, including commercial trade secrets, from theft. The same 
global networks that power innovation also open up new avenues for industrial espionage and 
the theft of intellectual property and commercial information  Cyberspace can be used to steal 
an unprecedented volume of information from businesses, universities, and government agen-
cies; such stolen information and technology can equal billions of dollars of lost value  Individual 

17★

★

InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe

incidents often go unreported or undetected  Results can range from unfair competition to 
the bankrupting of entire firms, and the national impact may be orders of magnitude larger  
The persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors 
working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ 
opportunities to innovate  The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such 
actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and 
impermissible, and hold such actors accountable 

 • Ensure the primacy of interoperable and secure technical standards, determined by tech-
nical experts. Developing international, voluntary, consensus-based cybersecurity standards 
and deploying products, processes, and services based upon such standards are the basis 
of an interoperable, secure and resilient global infrastructure  The public and private sectors 
must work together to develop, maintain, and implement these standards and support the 
development of international standards and conformity assessment schemes that prevent 
barriers to international trade and commerce  International cybersecurity standardization, and 
its voluntary and consensus-based processes, serves collective interests  They foster innovation; 
facilitate interoperability, security, and resiliency; improve trust in online transactions; and spur 
competition in global markets  The United States will foster collaboration between the public 
and private sector to ensure the promulgation of international standards-based requirements 
for products and services  

Protecting Our Networks: Enhancing Security, Reliability, and 
Resiliency
Because strong cybersecurity is critical to national and economic security in the broadest sense, we will:

 • Promote cyberspace cooperation, particularly on norms of behavior for states and cyber-
security, bilaterally and in a range of multilateral organizations and multinational part-
nerships. An increasing number of international organizations are taking up cybersecurity and 
other cyberspace issues, and the United States continues to promote this important work, build-
ing cyberspace into their range of work to meet the needs of their varied memberships  We have 
worked to include relevant cyberspace issues on the agenda at the Organization of American 
States (OAS), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC), the Organization for Cooperation and 
Security in Europe (OSCE), the African Union (AU), the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD), the Group of Eight (G-8), the European Union (EU), the United 
Nations (U N ), and the Council of Europe, and to ensure that work is supported by an effective 
institutional framework  The United States will continue, in these and other fora, to consolidate 
regional and international consensus on key cyberspace activities, including norms  We will 
also look to fora that enable multi-stakeholder collaboration and consensus building, to further 
elaborate the Internet policy principles outlined in this document  We welcome the expansion 
of this work to geographic regions currently underrepresented in the dialogue—most notably 
Africa and the Middle East—to further our interest in building worldwide capacity

III.  PolICy  PrIorITIes

 • Reduce intrusions into and disruptions of U.S. networks. Unauthorized network intrusions 
threaten the integrity of economies and undermine national security  Agencies across the United 
States Government are collaborating, together with the private sector, to protect innovation 
from industrial espionage, to protect Federal, state, and local government networks, to protect 
military operations from degraded operating environments, and to secure critical infrastruc-
ture against intrusions and attacks—particularly those on energy, transportation, or financial 
systems, and the defense industrial base  The United States will pursue a broad international 
consensus of states that recognize the importance of respect for property and network stabil-
ity, and will back up that conviction with our own and our partners’ willingness to defend our 
networks from acts that would compromise them  

 • Ensure robust incident management, resiliency, and recovery capabilities for information 
infrastructure. In an interconnected global environment, weak security in one nation’s systems 
compounds the risk to others  No one nation can have full insight into the world’s networks; we 
have an obligation to share our insights about our own networks and collaborate with others 
when events might threaten us all  As we continue to build and enhance our own response 
capabilities, we will work with other countries to expand the international networks that support 
greater global situational awareness and incident response—including between government 
and industry  The United States Government actively participates in watch, warning, and inci-
dent response through exchanging information with trusted networks of international partners  
We will expand these capabilities through international collaboration to enhance overall resil-
ience  The United States will also work to engage international participation in cybersecurity 
exercises, to elevate and strengthen established operating procedures with our partners  

 • Improve the security of the high-tech supply chain, in consultation with industry. The oper-
ation of critical networks and information infrastructures depends on the assured availability of 
trustworthy hardware and software  Vulnerabilities in the supply chain can enable attacks on 
the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of networks and the data they contain  Exploitation 
of these vulnerabilities impairs economic performance and national security  The United States 
will work with industry and international partners to develop best practices for protecting the 
integrity of information systems and critical infrastructure  In this way, we will greatly enhance 
the security of the globalized supply chains on which free and open trade depend 

Law Enforcement: Extending Collaboration and the Rule of Law
To enhance confidence in cyberspace and pursue those who would exploit online systems, we will:

 • Participate fully in international cybercrime policy development. The United States is com-
mitted to participating actively in discussions about how international norms and measures 
on cybercrime are developed bilaterally and multilaterally, in fora with proven expertise and a 
history of promoting effective cybercrime policies  These conversations will incorporate existing 
efforts, like how to extend the reach of institutions like the Budapest Convention  The United 
States will build these efforts upon the successful partnerships between national law enforce-
ment agencies and the productive policy dialogues that we currently enjoy, cultivating a sense 
of responsibility among states joining this effort 

19★

★

InTernaTIonal  sTraTegy  for  CyBersPaCe

 • Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to the Budapest 
Convention. The United States and our allies regularly depend upon cooperation and assistance 
from other countries when investigating and prosecuting cybercrime cases  This cooperation is 
most effective and meaningful when the countries have common cybercrime laws, which facili-
tates evidence-sharing, extradition, and other types of coordination  The Budapest Convention 
on Cybercrime provides countries with a model for drafting and updating their current laws, 
and it has proven to be an effective mechanism for enhancing international cooperation in 
cybercrime cases  The United States will continue to encourage other countries to become par-
ties to the Convention and will help current non-parties use the Convention as a basis for their 
own laws, easing bilateral cooperation in the short term, and preparing them for the possibility 
of accession to the Convention in the long term 

 • Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting access to the 
Internet. Criminal behavior in cyberspace should be met with effective law enforcement, not 
policies that restrict legitimate access to or content on the Internet  To advance this goal, the 
United States Government works on a bilateral and multilateral basis to ensure that countries 
recognize that online crimes should be approached by focusing on preventing crime and catch-
ing and punishing offenders, rather than by broadly limiting access to the Internet, as a broad 
limitation of access would affect innocent Internet users as well  As the United States and our 
partners engage in dialogue and help build capacity among law enforcement organizations 
worldwide, we will integrate this approach, uniting protection of privacy, fundamental freedoms, 
and innovation with collaboration to combat crimes in cyberspace  

 • Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the Internet for operational plan-
ning, financing, or attacks. The United States has a variety of international capacity-building 
and training programs on cybercrime, helping law enforcement and legislators develop effec-
tive legal frameworks and expertise to investigate and prosecute terrorist and other criminal 
misuse of the Internet  Preventing terrorists from enhancing capabilities through “hackers for 
hire” and organized crime tools is an important priority for the international community, and 
demands effective cybercrime laws  The United States is committed to tracking and disrupting 
terrorist and cybercrime finance networks through technical tools and international cooperation 
frameworks such as the Financial Action Task Force  

Military: Preparing for 21st Century Security Challenges
Since our commitment to defend our citizens, allies, and interests extends to wherever they might be 
threatened, we will:

 • Recognize and adapt to the military’s increasing need for reliable and secure networks. 
We recognize that our armed forces increasingly depend on the networks that support them, 
and we will work to ensure that our military remains fully equipped to operate even in an 
environment where others might seek to disrupt its systems, or other infrastructure vital to 
national defense  Like all nations, the United States has a compelling interest in defending its 
vital national assets, as well as our core principles and values, and we are committed to defend-
ing against those who would attempt to impede our ability to do so 

20★

III.  PolICy  PrIorITIes

 • Build and enhance existing military alliances to confront potential threats in cyberspace. 
Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international 
cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt or exploit our 
networks   This effort begins by acknowledging that the interconnected nature of networked 
systems of our closest allies, such as those of NATO and its member states, creates opportuni-
ties and new risks  Moving forward, the United States will continue to work with the militaries 
and civilian counterparts of our allies and partners to expand situational awareness and shared 
warning systems, enhance our ability to work together in times of peace and crisis, and develop 
the means and method of collective self-defense in cyberspace  Such military alliances and 
partnerships will bolster our collective deterrence capabilities and strengthen our ability to 
defend the United States against state and non-state actors 

 • Expand cyberspace cooperation with allies and partners to increase collective security. 
The challenges of cyberspace also create opportunities to work in new ways with allied and 
partner militaries  By developing a shared understanding of standard operating procedures, our 
armed forces can enhance security through coordination and greater information exchange; 
these engagements will diminish misperceptions about military activities and the potential for 
escalatory behavior  Dialogues and best practice exchanges to enhance partner capabilities, 
such as digital forensics, work force development, and network penetration and resiliency 
testing will be important to this effort  The United States will work in close partnership with 
like-minded states to leverage capabilities, reduce collective risk, and foster multi-stakeholder 
initiatives to deter malicious activities in cyberspace  

Internet Governance: Promoting Effective and Inclusive Structures
To promote Internet governance structures that effectively serve the needs of all Internet users, we will:

 • Prioritize openness and innovation on the Internet. The ability to distribute information 
efficiently on the Internet is at the very core of modern consumer, business, political, scientific, 
and educational activity  Governments around the globe recognize the value of the Internet; 
however, many of them place arbitrary restrictions on the free flow of information or use it to 
suppress dissent or opposition activities  The method and enforcement of these restrictions 
vary widely across countries, as do their justification, but we should not allow the Internet’s 
governance or technical architecture to be reengineered to accommodate decisions that 
violate fundamental freedoms, or unnecessarily stifle innovation  Effective, inclusive Internet 
governance can help ensure acts grossly outside international norms of acceptable network 
management are not compounded by a technical or governance structure that would enable 
them  Preserving, enhancing, and increasing access to an open, global Internet is a clear policy 
priority  The United States will continue to advance these goals through a variety of engage-
ments, including outreach to appropriate multi-stakeholder institutions and organizations, and 
to relevant intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations 

21★

 • Preserve global network security and stability, including the domain name system (DNS). 
Given the Internet’s importance to the world’s economy, it is essential that this network of 
networks and its underlying infrastructure, the DNS, remain stable and secure  To ensure this 
continued stability and security, it is imperative that we and the rest of the world continue to 
recognize the contributions of its full range of stakeholders, particularly those organizations and 
technical experts vital to the technical operation of the Internet  The United States recognizes 
that the effective coordination of these resources has facilitated the Internet’s success, and will 
continue to support those effective, multi-stakeholder processes  

 • Promote and enhance multi-stakeholder venues for the discussion of Internet gover-
nance issues. The very architecture of the Internet embodies a mode of social and technical 
organization which is decentralized, cooperative, and layered  Each of these characteristics is 
fundamental to the benefits the Internet has brought  That architecture fuels the freedom of 
innovation that enables economic growth  It fuels the freedom of expression and association 
that enables social and political growth and the functioning of democratic societies worldwide  
The United States stands firm in our conviction that when the international community meets 
to discuss the range of Internet governance issues, these conversations must take place in 
a multi-stakeholder manner; we will continue to support successful venues like the Internet 
Governance Forum, which embodies the open and inclusive nature of the Internet itself by 
allowing nongovernment stakeholders to contribute to the discussion on equal footing with 
governments 

International Development: Building Capacity, Security, and 
Prosperity
To promote the benefits of networked technology globally, enhance the reliability of our shared net-
works, and build the community of responsible stakeholders in cyberspace, we will:

 • Provide the necessary knowledge, training, and other resources to countries seeking to 
build technical and cybersecurity capacity. The benefits of an interconnected world should 
not be limited by national borders  For over a decade the United States has helped bridge that 
gap, supporting a variety of programs to help other nations gain the resources and skills to build 
core capacities in technology and cybersecurity  Our goal is to help other states learn from our 
experience, and in particular to build cybersecurity into their national technical development  
Because the needs are many and diverse, our programs range from supporting national capa-
bilities for incident management; to building public/private partnerships; to enhancing control 
systems security; to drafting effective laws to investigate and prosecute cybercrime; to develop-
ing and implementing programs to raise cybersecurity awareness and build a national culture 
of cybersecurity  Our work has taken place bilaterally, through foreign assistance, as well in 
partnership with innovative public-private initiatives like the United States Telecommunications 
Training Institute  In recent years, we have helped make this work a priority at multilateral fora 
such as the OAS, APEC, and the U N  The United States will expand these collaborations, work 
in-country to support private-sector investment in capacity, draw attention to this critical need, 
and work to build new collaborations in the coming years

III.  PolICy  PrIorITIes

 • Continually develop and regularly share international cybersecurity best practices. Today, 
nations no longer need to develop cybersecurity capacity exclusively through a process of trial 
and error  We have worked with dozens of other states and with numerous multilateral organiza-
tions to develop and share best practices designed to help states make wiser investments and 
develop more effective policies  The United States will continue to identify, develop, and refine 
best practices and technical standards in collaboration and close partnership with industry, and 
will expand our efforts to promote awareness of and access to them  We will further promote 
collaborative science and technology research to enhance cybersecurity tools and capabilities 

 • Enhance states’ ability to fight cybercrime—including training for law enforcement, 
forensic specialists, jurists, and legislators. Because criminal cases involving computer net-
works often involve evidence and targets located overseas, governments regularly rely on one 
another to provide often extensive technical and investigative assistance in matters relating to 
serious crime and national security  Criminal threats can originate from any connected country, 
and many countries need substantial help in developing the investigative capacities required 
to collaborate in such investigations  By providing training on these issues, we develop critical 
contacts and help promote law enforcement technical understanding  This engagement will 
increase the prospects for effective law enforcement cooperation and reciprocal assistance  The 
United States will continue to pursue this objective by providing training in numerous regions, 
continuing our work in Africa, and with APEC, ASEAN, G-8, and the OAS 

 • Develop relationships with policymakers to enhance technical capacity building, provid-
ing regular and ongoing contact with experts and their United States Government coun-
terparts. Over the last few years, a growing international community of policymakers focusing 
on cyberspace issues has provided new avenues for dialogue, launched new development and 
security initiatives, and strengthened countless bilateral relations  As we invest in developing 
countries’ long-term future through technical and cybersecurity capacity-building, the United 
States is committed to building those assistance relationships into closer partnerships on issues 
of mutual concern  We have taken a lead role in convening fora, such as the Meridian Conference, 
which fosters collaboration on critical information infrastructure protection issues  The United 
States welcomes more states entering into the dialogue as they become increasingly invested 
in the future of cyberspace, and will work to build enduring relationships among our experts 
and policymakers  

Internet Freedom: Supporting Fundamental Freedoms and Privacy
To help secure fundamental freedoms as well as privacy in cyberspace, we will: 

 • Support civil society actors in achieving reliable, secure, and safe platforms for freedoms 
of expression and association. We encourage people all over the world to use digital media to 
express opinions, share information, monitor elections, expose corruption, and organize social 
and political movements, and denounce those who harass, unfairly arrest, threaten, or commit 
violent acts against the people who use these technologies  Such cultures of fear discourage 
others in the community from using new technologies to report, organize, and exchange ideas

The same protections must apply to Internet Service Providers and other providers of con-
nectivity, who too often fall victim to legal regimes of intermediary liability that pass the role of 
censoring legitimate speech down to companies  The United States will be a tireless advocate 
of fundamental freedoms of speech and association through cyberspace; will work to empower 
civil society actors, human rights advocates, and journalists in their use of digital media; and will 
work to encourage governments to address real cyberspace threats, rather than impose upon 
companies responsibilities of inappropriately limiting either freedom of expression or the free 
flow of information 

 • Collaborate with civil society and nongovernment organizations to establish safeguards 
protecting their Internet activity from unlawful digital intrusions. Promoting cybersecu-
rity among civil society and nongovernmental organizations helps ensure that freedoms of 
speech and association are more widely enjoyed in the digital age  Cybersecurity is particularly 
important for activists, advocates, and journalists on the front lines who may express unpopular 
ideas and opinions, and who are frequently the victims of disruptions and intrusions into their 
email accounts, websites, mobile phones, and data systems  The United States supports efforts 
to empower these users to protect themselves, to help ensure their ability to exercise their free 
expression and association rights on the new technologies of the 21st century 

 • Encourage international cooperation for effective commercial data privacy protections. 
Protecting individual privacy is essential to maintaining the trust that sustains economic and 
social uses of the Internet  The United States has a robust record of enforcement of its privacy 
laws, as well as encouraging multi-stakeholder policy development  We are continuing to 
strengthen the U S  commercial data privacy framework to keep pace with the rapid changes 
presented by networked technologies  We recognize the role of applying general privacy 
principles in the commercial context while maintaining the flexibility necessary for innovation  
The United States will work toward building mutual recognition of laws that achieve the same 
objectives and enforcement cooperation to protect privacy and promote innovation 

 • Ensure the end-to-end interoperability of an Internet accessible to all. Users should have 
confidence that the information they transmit over the Internet will be received as it was 
intended, anywhere in the world  Equally important is the expectation that under normal cir-
cumstances, data will flow across borders without regard for its national origin or destination  
Ensuring the integrity of information as it flows over the Internet gives users confidence in the 
network and keeps the Internet open as a reliable platform for innovation that drives growth in 
the global economy and encourages the exchange of ideas among people around the world  
The United States will continue to make clear the benefits of an Internet that is global in nature, 
while opposing efforts to splinter this network into national intranets that deprive individuals 
of content from abroad

IV. Moving forward

The benefits of networked technology should not be reserved to a privileged few nations, or a privileged 
few within them  But connectivity is no end unto itself; it must be supported by a cyberspace that is 
open to innovation, interoperable the world over, secure enough to earn people’s trust, and reliable 
enough to support their work  

Thirty years ago, few understood that something called the Internet would lead to a revolution in 
how we work and live  In that short time, millions now owe their livelihoods—and even their lives—to 
advances in networked technology  A billion more rely on it for everyday forms of social interaction  
This technology propels society forward, accomplishing things previous generations scarcely thought 
possible  For our part, the United States will continue to spark the creativity and imagination of our 
people, and those around the world  We cannot know what the next great innovation will be, but are 
committed to realizing a world in which it can take shape and flourish  

This strategy is a roadmap allowing the United States Government’s departments and agencies to better 
define and coordinate their role in our international cyberspace policy, to execute a specific way forward, 
and to plan for future implementation  It is a call to the private sector, civil society, and end-users to 
reinforce these efforts through partnership, awareness, and action  Most importantly, it is an invitation 
to other states and peoples to join us in realizing this vision of prosperity, security, and openness in 
our networked world  These ideals are central to preserving the cyberspace we know, and to creating, 
together, the future we seek
