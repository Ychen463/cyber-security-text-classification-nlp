Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs 
December 2016  

 

Executive Summary 

Online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services are considered as Digital Service Pro-
viders (DSPs) in the context of the recently adopted Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and 
of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and infor-
mation systems across the Union, hereafter referred to as the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive.  

The NIS Directive aims to bring cybersecurity capabilities on the same level of development in all the EU Mem-
ber States. Its purpose is to ensure that exchange of information and cooperation related to security amongst 
Member States are efficient, including at the cross-border level1. With NIS becoming a requirement, the intro-
duction of specific laws in this area across the European Union will have a significant impact to all industry sec-
tors including those relating to DSP categories.   

Many businesses in the Union rely on these DSPs for the provision of their services. Some digital services could 
be an important resource for their users, including Operators of Essential Services (OES), and as such users 
might not always have alternatives available. The security, continuity and reliability of the type of digital ser-
vices referred to in this Directive are of the essence for the smooth functioning of many businesses. A disrup-
tion of such a digital service could prevent the provision of other services which depend on it and could conse-
quently have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the Union. Such digital services might there-
fore be critical for the smooth functioning of businesses that depend on them, for the internal market and 
cross- border trade across the Union2. 

It is essential for all Member States to make sure that they have minimum capabilities to ensure a high level of 
NIS in their territory and to improve the functioning of the internal market. Commonly defined security 
measures can support harmonised security practices across EU Member States and potentially enhance the 
overall level of NIS in the EU. 

Therefore, ENISA has issued this report to assist Member States and DSPs in providing a common approach re-
garding the security measures for DSPs. Although ENISA has already drafted a set of security objectives in the 
context of cloud security in 20143, this study goes further than that by broadening the scope of its work and by 
including security objectives for all three categories of digital service providers. This study lists 27 Security Ob-
jectives (SOs) for DSPs. In those 27 SOs, security measures that map to the NIS Directive requirements4 are also 
included.  

This particular initiative has been achieved by examining current information and network security practices for 
the DSPs across the EU. It has brought light to some important findings that can add to existing security objec-
tives and measures in information technology infrastructures in Europe. It is recommended that stakeholders 
and responsible parties analyse their information security needs in detail in order to evaluate and adapt each of 
the security objectives and measures according to their specific business requirements.

1.  Introduction 

  Background 

1.1.1  General introduction 

The world is becoming increasingly interconnected as industries continue to revolutionize and knowledge 
continues to be shared. With the advent of digital services, network and information systems and services 
are becoming highly crucial to the society. Thus, it is imperative that their security and reliability is signifi-
cantly ensured. 

In fact, if security and resilience of networks and information systems are not ensured, this can impede the 
pursuit of economic activities, lead to financial losses, undermine the confidence or cause major damage to 
the economy of a country. For example, network and information systems, and primarily the Internet, play 
an essential role in facilitating the cross–border movement of goods, services and people. Substantial dis-
ruptions of those systems, whether intentional or unintentional and regardless of where they occur, can 
affect individual Member States and the Union as a whole.  Knowing how to properly address network and 
information security is key to avoid any damaging effects. 

DSPs  operate  in a fast changing environment and  should ensure a level of security  proportionate  to the 
degree of risk posed to the digital services they provide. Responsibilities in ensuring the security of network 
and information systems lie to a great extent with DSPs themselves. A culture of risk management, involving 
risk assessment and the implementation of security measures appropriate to the risks faced, should be pro-
moted and developed through appropriate regulatory requirements, standards and commonly acceptable 
industry practices.  

1.1.2  Objectives 

The objectives of this report are to: 

  Define common baseline security objectives for Digital Service Providers (DSPs).   
  Describe different levels of sophistication in the implementation of security objectives.  
  Map the security objectives against well-known industry standards, national frameworks and certi-

fication schemes.  

1.1.3  Scope & Target Audience 

This study analyses the security objectives by providing security measures and examples of implementation 
concerning the digital service providers and in particular:  

  Cloud computing service providers  
  Online marketplaces 
  Online search engines  

 
The three DSP categories are described in the NIS Directive5 as follows: 

  Online marketplaces:  

An online marketplace allows consumers and/or traders to conclude online sales and service con-
tracts with traders, and is the final destination for the conclusion of those contracts. It does not 

                                                             

5 Preambles (15), (16) and (17) of the NIS Directive 

07 

 

Technical guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for DSPs 
December 2016  

cover online services that serve only as an intermediary to third-party services where a contract 
can ultimately be concluded. It therefore does not cover online services that compare the price of 
particular products or services from different traders, and then redirect the user to the preferred 
trader to purchase the product. Computing services provided by the online marketplace may in-
clude processing of transactions, aggregations  of data or profiling of users. Application stores, 
which operate as online stores enabling the digital distribution of applications or software pro-
grammes from third parties, are to be understood as being a type of online marketplace 

  Online search engines:   

An online search engine should allow the user to perform searches of in principle all websites on 
the basis of a query on any subject. It may alternatively be focused on websites in a particular 
language. The definition of an online search engine provided in this  Directive should not cover 
search functions that are limited to the content of a specific website, irrespective of whether the 
search function is provided by an external search engine. It should also not cover online services 
that compare the price of particular products or services from different traders, and then redirect 
the user to the preferred trader to purchase the product. 

  Cloud computing service providers:  

Cloud computing services span a wide range of activities that can be delivered according to differ-
ent models. For the purposes of this report, "cloud computing services" means services that enable 
access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable computing resources. The term "computing re-
sources" covers resources such as networks, servers or other infrastructure, storage, applications 
and services. "Scalable" means  that, in order to handle fluctuations  in demand, computing re-
sources are flexibly allocated by the cloud service provider irrespective of the geographical location 
of the resources. 

 

The articles 4(17), (18) and (19) of the NIS Directive provide the definitions of the DSPs.  

 

Privacy is of outmost importance for the personal data being processed by DSPs but it is considered out of 
scope for this particular report. This is because, there is a good deal of data protection requirements (i.e. 
consent of the  data subject, the  purpose  definition, proportionality of collected data etc.) and tools (i.e. 
privacy by design, privacy impact assessment, privacy seals, notifications of the processing to and audits by 
the national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and data breach notifications) which are examined under a 
very specific piece of EU Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The identification of 
the entire set of organisational and technical measures which are deemed adequate to GDPR is a subject for 
thorough analysis which exceeds the boundaries of the current undertaking. For this reason, this report fo-
cuses only on the objectives which are solely considered most relevant to the security element of the infor-
mation systems and data maintained by the DSPs. However, some security measures described herein i.e. 
encryption, secure disposal of data, media access policy etc. are extensively used to address data protection 
requirements as well. 

1.1.4  Document overview 

 

The report lists and describes  the high-level security objectives for the DSP  categories together with the 
different  sophistication  levels  in  the  implementation  of  security  measures.  For  each  sophistication  level 
(basic, industry-standard and state of the art), the corresponding measures and examples are provided.

The report also provides a mapping between security objectives, industry standards, certification schemes 
and national frameworks. The goal of the mapping is to allow DSP communities to understand more easily 
if their NIS requirements and security objectives meet the requirements of those frameworks.   

1.1.5  Methodology 

This study is based on the Cloud Certification Schemes Meta framework (CCSM) released in November 20146 
by ENISA, regarding cloud service providers. This tool is a meta-framework that provides a neutral high-level 
mapping from the customer's Network and Information Security requirements to security objectives in ex-
isting cloud certification schemes. 

Additional security objectives concerning cloud services that may have come into play since 2014 have also 
been examined. The list of objectives has been validated with the ENISA Cloud Expert Group through extra 
consultation and a validation workshop. 

A questionnaire was developed and a publicly available online survey was launched in order to identify sev-
eral security controls and measures implemented, along with good practices and standards deployed by DSP 
and in particular online market places and online search engines. 

The diagram below illustrates the relationship between security requirements, security objectives and se-
curity measures which are key terminologies that have been used throughout the document. Further to this, 
examples of these terminologies are also described below.

  Security requirement:  

Customers have security requirements. In the procurement phase customers usually check 
which security requirements are met by the security objectives of the provider. This process is 
often referred to as due-diligence. 

  Security objectives:  

Providers have security objectives. Objectives are high-level goals and usually do not include 
many technical details. For example, “we offer an uptime of 99.9%”, or “customer data cannot 
be accessed by unauthorized personnel”. Security objectives are sometimes grouped in “security 
domains” (e.g. “software security”). Security objectives are sometimes called “control objec-
tives”). 

  Security measures:  

Providers have security measures in place, to reach the security objectives. Security measures 
are sometimes called “controls” or “security controls”-. 

 

The report also provides a mapping between security objectives and the following industry standards, cer-
tification schemes and national frameworks:

2.  List of security objectives and measures for DSPs 

  Description 

 
For each security objective we provide:  
 

  Brief description of the security objective.  

 

Levels of sophistication on the implementation of security measures with examples. 

  A mapping with industry standards, certification schemes and national frameworks 

 

The list below, categorizes security measures into three sophistication levels. Each level contains the practices to 
assess the adequacy of the design and evidence that should be provided in order to check the effective implemen-
tation of the security practice. For each security objective, we have provided security measures that are either basic, 
industry-standard or state of the art. Readers can refer to the table below for the definition of each of these sophis-
tication levels7 and can also refer to the list below for an overview of the security levels of each objective.

cises, to proactively improve the implementation of security measures 

-Examples of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review pro-
cess, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security measures. 

3 – State of the art 

 

Sophistication levels are applied independently to each objective. As a result, a DSP may receive different 
sophistication ratings for different objectives. It is important to realise that the sophistication levels that are 
applicable to a given organisation depend on its specific characteristics such as its size or the services pro-
vided. For example, for a provider with only 5 employees it may be unnecessary to have a security policy 
that is fully aligned with best practice industry standards, or to have a documented formal procedure for 
hiring personnel. 

The practices that complete each sophistication level are selected from relevant standards, guidelines and 
frameworks which have been identified during the stock taking exercise and described in the section 1.1.5.

  The role of risk assessment 

DSPs wishing to establish, implement, operate, monitor and continuously maintain and improve an appro-
priate level of security, must also carefully and continuously consider and assess the actual level of prepar-
edness and the related security risks they face. 

A risk assessment should be performed throughout the system life cycle: during requirements definition, 
procurement, control definition and configuration, system operations, and system close-out. 

A “Risk Assessment” (RA) would be, in this context, an important step to be performed before deciding the 
required sophistication levels needed by the DSP. The extent and granularity of the Risk Assessment should 
take  into  account  several  factors  such  as  the  size  of  the  organisation,  the  implementation  cost  of  the 
measures etc. 

The risk assessment allows the DSP to define a threshold for the minimum acceptance level before the es-
tablishment of a risk  value  and to perform the  risk  assessment for the  assets in scope. Therefore, a risk 
assessment is a key preliminary  step that should be  conducted in order to  understand what risk  level is 
appropriate/acceptable  for  each  organisation  before  deciding  upon  the  required  sophistication  levels 
needed by DSPs. 

The organisation should select specific controls, measures and sophistication levels by considering and ef-
fectively using the results of the risk assessment. This way, the proposed security measures could be consid-
ered as an appropriate benchmark enabling the security managers to determine which specific aspects of 
security require attention and priority within their respective organisations. 

Establishing a security benchmark within a context that has been defined by DSP security experts is consid-
ered to be a successful formula, because such a benchmark can be properly focused on DSP specific security 
issues. Such benchmark can complement the outcome of the risk assessment and provide an additional input 
for defining and selecting the specific controls, measures and sophistication levels for the security of the 
services offered by the DSPs. 

The  above-described  proposed  approach  is  aligned  with  general  risk  management  good  practices  –  and 
therefore will help create synergies between the risk management and the security efforts of the DSP. In 
contrast with a compliance based approach, this approach is considered to be more pragmatic and efficient. 
Moreover, the proposed approach is considered to be more powerful because it takes into consideration 
the specific characteristics of DSPs. Therefore, it can be applied to a wide range of DSPs independently of 
their size or maturity. 

The use of sophistication levels allows the definition of different quality requirements for each measure. 
This approach is different from a maturity level approach because, in practice, an organisation will probably 
not have all its measures developed to the same level of maturity. 

The identification of a suitable risk assessment methodology for DSPs is beyond the scope of this report; 
therefore, it has not been described in detail. Only the relevance and usefulness of performing a suitable 
risk assessment, before deciding the required sophistication levels, was highlighted (SO 02: Risk Manage-
ment).

SECURITY MEASURES 

EXAMPLES 

Implement processes and procedures which allow 
customers to interact with services and/or if 
needed to migrate to other providers offering simi-
lar services, in an easy and basic way 

  Use of HTML/XML which allow users to integrate dif-

ferent services and to (more easily) migrate from 
one provider to another   

  Use of OVF standard format for virtual machines  

Implement industry standard security measures, 
which promote interoperability and portability, in-
cluding fall-back procedures (for example in the 
case of cloud computing services). 

 

 

Set up state of the art controls to facilitate in-
teroperability & portability.  
Evaluate and review the effectiveness of in-
teroperability & portability measures. 

  Use of SAML/XACML that acts as an interface to 

manage the provision of identification and user au-
thentication between user and provider  

  Documentation about how the protection and integ-
rity of infrastructure & virtualization security is main-
tained. 
Information on the fallback procedures is explicitly 
described. 

 

 

State of the art controls exist and are a crucial aspect 
to mitigate security related risks for customers  

  Where applicable, tools for detection of anomalous 

usage or risks associated is used, which allows the 
option for customer to plan in advance the interop-
erability & portability measures.

3.    Summary 

To summarise, the level of sophistication to which security measures are implemented from one organization to 
another can vary for a multitude of reasons. For instance, this may depend on the industry sector, the size of the 
company or the time and effort that the management can afford to invest in implementing security measures. 
From the received feedback for this study, stakeholders should consider the different roles that the DSP’s play in 
the online environment, and in particular how their level of criticality differs (i.e. lack of availability for a search 
engine may not pose a significant risk, whereas for a different DSP, this may be more critical). As a result, some 
security objectives may be prioritized over others and thus the sophistication levels may also differ. 

There are high level security objectives, which are interchangeable among all three DSP categories, while a few 
belong to specific DSP categories. In the following table, the common security objectives for all DSPs are marked 
with a check mark. If a SO doesn’t belong to a specific DSP category, it is indicated with an xmark.
